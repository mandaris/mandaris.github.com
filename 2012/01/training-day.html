</header><p>Today, I met my replacement at work.</p>
<p>He's a lot older than I expected<sup id="fnref:expected"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:expected" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> which got me worried. How bad is it out there to find a job?</p>
<p>But it also got me thinking about how our disposable culture. How is it even though everyone seemed to like me at work that I'm still facing a hard end date for leaving and finding something else. I was part of the team, a reliable rock that could get things moving...</p>
<p>But in a couple weeks, I'll be gone and that person I trained will be doing what I did for them. </p>
<p>Honestly, I don't blame the guy and <em>some</em> people have said that I should withhold some of the knowledged that I've accumulated along the way, but I won't do that because I don't need the bad karma and I'm not in the business of burning bridges. The guy is actually pretty nice and was quiet and just soaked up what I was telling him.</p>
<p>He generally liked my teaching style<sup id="fnref:teach"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:teach" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and we even had a great discussion about how development works. I spent a lot of time explaining things and it was nice to show someone all the little things that I have to do every day. I wish him the best, but I wish for better things going forward.</p>

<p>For some reason, I had an thought that whoever it was would be someone who was a handsome and good looking as I was.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:expected" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Which I find to be a great compliment. I truly enjoy teaching people things and seeing them suceed. &#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:teach" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
