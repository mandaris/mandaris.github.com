</header><p>I've signed up for a <a href="https://toughmudder.com">Tough Mudder</a> race in March and I'm woefully unprepared for it. I've been doing small things to increase my physical health, but I've got to change a lot of things if I even want to stand a chance of making it out without getting hurt.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that is the goal for me. It started as a whim but now I want to prove something to myself. I've already made the financial commitment and I need to put my body where my money is.</p>

</header><p>I've almost finished the probation period at my new job and I've got to say that it feels good to have made it this far. I work hard and I think the people around me see that and want me to suceed just as much as I do.</p>
<p>Still, it wasn't always fun because of the learning curve and... well... the people.</p>
<p>I consider myself a people person in a lot of respects. It really isn't natural for me because I had no understanding of tact back in jr. high school seeing as most of my interactions were with books and movies. I was picked on quite a lot and it wasn't until college that I started to really grow as a person.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, and I'm seeing other people who are still growing as people. Some more mature and some not as much. Everyone has there own motivations.</p>

</header><p>Things have been moving kind of fast at work and that has spilled over into my personal life. In the process of moving to a more stable life where I'm not worried so much about making rent for that month. At the end of the day, I'm very grateful that I not only have a job, but a job where I'm helping maintian the foundation of our society.</p>
<p>This hasn't left me with a lot of energy to work on my projects. A lot of the things I want to work on have had to take a step back as I get things figured out.</p>

</header><p>So, I backed the micro.blog kickstarter founded by Manto Reese. It  seems like a really cool project to get involved in. I like the idea of owning my own content when I post on the internet. With all kinds of weird stuff happening on Twitter, I don't know what will happen with the service and whether I want to support something like that.</p>

</header><p>I sometimes look at the things that I’ve accomplished versus the things that I think that I should have accomplished. It’s always in a negative light because you can’t compete with a fantasy like that. </p>
<p>I think that I may actually grow up this year. I might be the person that I really set out to be. </p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>I might be able to look myself in the eye every morning knowing that I did my best for that day.</p>
<p>I’d like to know that my children have had a positive male role model in their life and understand what it means to treat people with respect. And above all, treat themselves with respect.</p>
<p>I think I might have a chance to actually have peace of mind this year. It’s really about me going out there and doing what needs to be done. </p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be a chore. It’s just life and it is up to me to live it.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I started to pick at the way that I look and sound. Of course, but I'm excited about doing this and making the video better than this one. Small steps, right?</p>

</header><p>Today, I'm having trouble getting started in my alloted time to make something. I really just want to go home, eat and sleep. I think it is because it is the end of the day at the tail end of the week.</p>
<p>I was just going to make a post and call it a night when I remembered that I can make a small video on my laptop and you can see the result below.</p>

<p>This has been on the back of my mind of a while and I thought it would help to get a more formal grasp of what I wanted to do with my up coming video. </p>
<p>I've also been putting together the keynote that I'll be using to back the screen shots and videos I'll be taking. With this being my outline, I think I can start taking the video I need this weekend.</p>
