      What is on my mind right now
    </a>
  </h2>
</header><div class="e-content post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
<p><img alt="Mindmap of what is on my mind." src="images/what-is-up.png"></p>
<p>I just spent 5 minutes on what are some of the things that are currently on my mind. Honestly, I think I spent more time on the clip art associated with the mindmap than actually thinking about what it means. </p>
<p>I've got a lot of things happening right now and I hoped that putting it in a pretty picture can help me sort it out. So...</p>
<h3 id="whats-up">What’s Up</h3>
<p>Ultimately, I exported the mind map as an outline and decided to  expand it here.</p>
<h4 id="work">Work</h4>
<p>The way that I currently make a living. I find that I'm grinding for someone else and not me or my family.</p>
<h5 id="doing-the-work">Doing the work</h5>
<p>I don't feel that I have a huge problem doing what is asked of me. I <em>do</em> have a problem with the amount of things that need to be done and the amount of support that I'm getting from everyone else. I feel as though a lot of people don't understand that things need to be balanced.</p>
<h5 id="dealing-with-the-people">Dealing with the People</h5>
<p>I do not feel that the people that I'm working with are on the same page. Sometimes, I feel like I'm all by myself on a lot of fronts. I have friends at work, but I also have people who are more into their own ego than getting to the next level in life.</p>
<p>Definitely room for more teamwork. </p>
<h4 id="making-ends-meet">Making ends meet</h4>
<p>Money is absolutely horrible. They say it cannot make you happy, but I find that not having it certainly can make you unhappy.</p>
<h5 id="cutting-expenses">Cutting expenses</h5>
<p>No question. Have to cut back on soo many things. I've started taking my lunch and I've long since stopped buying comic books. The problem is that me and my family like to go out to eat quite a bit.</p>
<h5 id="making-more">Making More</h5>
<p>I've been playing around with the idea of getting a second job. It would have to be a night position, but I don't know if I'd be able to pull it off with the lack of sleep that would eventually happen.</p>
<h4 id="being-fulfilled">Being fulfilled</h4>
<p>This one is just about how I feel about myself. I feel as if I lost my direction in life and I'm really questioning if I had one at all. </p>
<h5 id="what-is-my-current-passion">What is my current passion?</h5>
<p>I like messing around with MacOS X. I love the feel of typing and the pleasure of getting things like my website up and running.</p>
<p>But I want to make something else too.</p>
<p>Not just this blog post but something that can help others, like a tutorial or book.</p>
<h5 id="where-do-i-see-myself-in-the-future">Where do I see myself in the future?</h5>
<p>Unfortunately, the future looks grim. I've got upcoming expenses and less time and resources to deal with them.</p>
<h4 id="having-a-family">Having a family</h4>
<p>The most important aspect. I have a responsibility not just to myself but to other people.</p>
<h5 id="being-able-to-communicate">Being able to communicate</h5>
<p>I want to make sure that my family is able to talk to me if they need to and that I work on my active listening.</p>
<h5 id="making-sure-that-everyone-is-cared-for">Making sure that everyone is cared for</h5>
<p>I love my family and it is important to me that they are happy.</p>
<h3 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h3>
<p>What a small little rant. I feel much better getting that out of my system and will have to review this moving forward.</p>

<p>Here are somethings that I'm thinking about working on</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing. I want to work on my communication via writing. I think that I can be better served by focusing on making my writing better. Both with grammar and how I express ideas.</li>
<li>Web Design. Just making it look nicer would make me feel better about giving the url to people</li>

<p>I'm slowing making progress on my blog. It doesn't look like much because I don't have any css associated with it. I'm ok with it looks a little rough for now because I want to focus on the design for now and I rally don't think I'm going to get a lot of people checking it out between now and whenever...</p>
<p>What I would like do is challenge myself to do more than just play around on my computer. I've been spend more and more time becoming aware of the little clock in the upper right hand corner of the screen that tells me how productive I've been on my Mac.</p>
<p><img alt="Image of Timing in Menubar showing that I am 62% productive." src="../../images/timing_clock_menubaritem.png" title="Timing showing that I could be doing more."></p>
<p>Personally, I feel that every little bit counts towards becoming an adult. I can't go back to the days where I only had to worry about homework any more. In fact,I no longer wish for those days because I understand that even then I had some kind of struggle going on. The me now, is a lot more self aware and more confident in who I am.</p>

<p>I’ve been torn on what to do next with my website. I like a <a href="https://github.com/kplaube/yapeme">new theme</a> and I want to use it but it would require either a rewrite of my posts or a change of the theme that the original writer has put together.</p>
<p>I feel like I’m going to just rewrite the theme to meet my needs, but I’m hesitant to start a new project where the scope may run away from me. </p>
<p>I think I’ll start off with just small goals of changing things little by little. First, I’ll start by automating the generation of the sight and then making small changes to the them. </p>

<p>I was really happy that changing the template for my writing wasn’t a hard task to do and I got it done fairly quickly. I’ve run into a number <sup id="fnref:what"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:what">1</a></sup> of problems in the last couple of months  and I enjoyed the ego boost. </p>
<p>All in all, a pretty good day and I got some serious things checked off I my life. </p>
<p>Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dropping off and picking up the children </li>
<li>Going to Costco </li>
<li>Get a pair of glasses </li>
<li>Taking the family to an outing</li>
<li>And finishing the new markdown template </li>

<p>Probably on of the better days that I’ve had this month. </p>

<p>Tomorrow, I want to focus on getting my cell phone writing work flow to be a little smoother. Currently, I use a template that I created in editorial to get the header for pelican and then I start writing until I feel that I've gotten the idea finished. </p>
<p>I also had to take my car to the shop where I found out that I'm looking at a big repair bill. The wife and I are going to try and fix it ourselves. But it's going to be hard because I don't know how complicated it's going to be and where I'm going to get the parts. </p>
