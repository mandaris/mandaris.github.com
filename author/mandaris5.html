      Getting mdx_downheader to work

</header><div class="e-content post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>In my <a href="/2018/06/blog-accomplishments.html" title="Blog Accomplishments «Mandaris Moore»">last post</a>, I left off with a list of things that I wanted to work on for the next release of the design of the blog. I'm still changing the header at the top of the page and I've been working on improving the contrast of the colors you see for links to make it easier to read. Something you can't spot just by looking is the fact that <code>&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h3&gt;</code> tags don't correspond to the breakdown of the syntax of the rest of the site.</p>
<p><img alt="A small sample of the code that was being generated." src="images/sample-of-previous-syntax.png" title="Generated HTML in Sublime looks cool!"></p>
<h3 id="what-do-i-see-on-the-internet">What do I see on the internet</h3>
<p>I feel that a lot of the sites that are on the internet only use the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> tags and looking at some of the templates that I've come across for pelican use css classes to differentiate them in the design. </p>
<p>I don't have a problem with that, but I felt that it doesn't help those that might be using some kind of screen reader or parsing system<sup id="fnref:seo"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:seo">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="searching-for-a-solution">Searching for a solution</h3>
<p>Once again, I started looking for a place where this had already been fixed and quickly found one that would make sure that the html that <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html">python-markdown</a> would give me would match what I was expecting to give to my <a href="https://github.com/mandaris/modest" title="A very simple template for pelican">template</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cprieto">Christian Prieto</a> had already come up with this <a href="https://github.com/cprieto/mdx_downheader" title="Python Markdown Down Header Extension">handy solution</a> in 2016 and had put some tests and an example of how to incorporate it into pelican.</p>
<h3 id="but-there-are-further-complications">But there are further complications</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, pelican has changed since the original and I wasn't able to get the solution to work. The readme says to add the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">MD_EXTENSIONS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;downheader&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But the latest documentation found <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/settings.html" title="Pelican Settings">here</a>, have the markdown default to be defined as a dictionary and not an array<sup id="fnref:doc"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:doc">2</a></sup>. The simplest way to get it to work is to change your <code>pelicanconfig.py</code> to have the following code.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Markdown Plugins</span>
<span class="n">MARKDOWN</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;extension_configs&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.codehilite&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;css_class&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;highlight&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.extra&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.meta&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
<span class="hll">        <span class="s1">&#39;downheader&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
</span>    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;output_format&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;html5&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For me, I had to specify a value because the title of my site is in a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag and the article headers are in <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Markdown Plugins</span>
<span class="n">MARKDOWN</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;extension_configs&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.codehilite&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;css_class&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;highlight&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.extra&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.meta&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
<span class="hll">        <span class="s1">&#39;downheader&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;levels&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;2&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I've since made a <a href="https://github.com/cprieto/mdx_downheader/pull/5">pull request</a> so that others can get around this as well.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I'm happier and happier with the way that the site is coming together, but I'm afraid of the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a> that the site is accruing as I go along. I've to to make the readme a priority for those who come after me and want to make this design better.</p>
<p>I've also taken some time to just take the header and just make a <a href="https://github.com/mandaris/pelican-headers">standalone project</a> that demonstrates how it works. I points to the <code>simple</code> theme that comes with pelican so people can just download it after installing pelican, python-markdown and the mdx_downheader package.</p>

</header><div class="e-content post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I think I'm ready to mark my second pelican theme 1.0 as "Feature Complete" today! I started off with -what I thought- a simple premise of having a site site took a lot longer than I expected but I'm pretty happy with the site for now.  But before I tag it and start working on 2.0, I want to go over what I've done so far.</p>
<p><img alt="Visualization of what I've accomplished with the blog." src="/images/blog-accomplishments.png"> </p>
<h3 id="parsable">Parsable</h3>
<p>The first thing I started researching was how to make the site parsable by webcrawlers. Although it's a personal blog, I wanted people to be able to find the content easily.</p>
<h4 id="opengraph">OpenGraph</h4>
<p>OpenGraph was the first thing that I came across and appealed to me the most because it's the preferred way of parsing data for Twitter<sup id="fnref:twitter"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:twitter">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I found it especially rewarding that the tags are also parsed by facebook and my new favorite social network <a href="https://slack.com">slack</a>. </p>
<p>One of the technical difficulties that I ran into when adding OpenGraph tags was adding the images. The specification for OpenGraph states that images to be used need to be added as meta data in the head of the html. This can be a pain as the other data like title and date can be pulled from the article itself and I didn't want to go through all my old posts to add image meta data.</p>
<p>Luckily, the  github user WhiskyEchoBravo had a <a href="https://github.com/whiskyechobravo/pelican-open_graph">project that searched the content of the post for images</a> and added the first to the list of tags. I'm a little proud that I helped with issues with <a href="https://github.com/whiskyechobravo/pelican-open_graph/commit/61248d805588245a9fc1dc4eda56cff1f5a9d8fa">pages</a>. </p>
<p>Afterwards, I did run into some frustration when the images that I added to posts wouldn't be as big as I expected.</p>
<p><img alt="Post in slack with a small image." src="images/slack-small-image.png"></p>
<p>Ultimately, I think it's because of the mixing and matching of having OpenGraph and twitter specific tags and was solved it by making sure I used the following for my twitter card.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">meta</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;twitter:card&quot;</span> <span class="na">content</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;summary_large_image&quot;</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now I get the post to unfurl nicely.</p>
<p><img alt="Post in slack with a large image." src="images/slack-large-image.png"></p>
<h4 id="schemaorg">Schema.org</h4>
<p>This is the styling used by both Bing and Google. I put this in as a challenge to myself to make it work in both instances. I leaned a lot from the example on <a href="https://orbitingweb.com/blog/schema-org-microdata-guide/" title="Complete Schema.Org and Microdata Tutorial for beginners">OrbitingWeb</a> and refined what I was working with using <a href="https://github.com/philwareham/schema-microdata-examples/blob/master/blog.html" title="Schema.org microdata examples">another example</a> that I found on github.</p>
<h3 id="valid-semantic-tags">Valid Semantic Tags</h3>
<p>For this, I just wanted to use some of those really cool semantic tags that html5 has given to us. When I look at the code for some pages on the internet I see a lot of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags with classes that could be replaced with <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,  or <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags.</p>
<p>I'm willing to just attribute it to my desire to have my own style or maybe just inexperience, but I'm happy to report that the site passes html validation except for the OpenGraph definitions found in the header.</p>
<h4 id="figure-it-out">figure it out</h4>
<p>One technical hurdle I ran into was that I wanted my images to be wrapped in the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tag and also have a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tag that would have the alternative text. </p>
<p>I searched for a plugin for pelican<sup id="fnref:figure-ref"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:figure-ref">2</a></sup>, but the closest thing I could find was <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/liquid_tags">liquid tags</a> at the time<sup id="fnref:liquid"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:liquid">3</a></sup>.  </p>
<p>I did find jdittrich <a href="https://github.com/jdittrich/figureAltCaption">figureAltCaption</a> project on github which was a extension for the <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/">python-markdown</a>  that pelican uses. I even submitted a <a href="https://github.com/jdittrich/figureAltCaption/pull/3" title="Still wait to be pulled into the main branch">pull request</a>  to allow it to do reference links!</p>
<p>There was a little confusion on getting it to work because pelican has been changing since some of these plugins were created.</p>
<p>Long story short, I had to add the following to my <code>pelicanconfig.py</code> to get it to work.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>   <span class="c1"># Markdown Plugins</span>
<span class="n">MARKDOWN</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;extension_configs&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.codehilite&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;css_class&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;highlight&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.extra&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.meta&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
<span class="hll">        <span class="s1">&#39;figureAltCaption&#39;</span><span class="p">:{},</span>
</span>    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;output_format&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;html5&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="easy-to-share">Easy to share</h3>
<p>I wrote down that I wanted the site to be easy to share and it is when you look at the amount of tags and metadata that is in every page. </p>
<p>At one point, I wanted to add share buttons, but -with the rise in concerns about privacy- I wanted the users of the site to be the ones who would share it.</p>
<p>Also, I'm still working on color schemes so the buttons might clash with whatever I end up with.</p>
<p><img alt="Clash of the social buttons!" src="images/supported-social-networks.jpg" title="The number of ways to share an article is too dang high!"></p>
<h3 id="accessible">Accessible</h3>
<p>One of the underlining principles of this site design is that I wanted it to be accessible to as many people as possible. It's part of the reason that I've worked so hard on making sure that I included so many semantic tags. I didn't think that this was particularly hard to do when you understand what needs to happen before you begin. </p>
<p>The theme doesn't have any errors at this point, but does loose some points because of the way that markdown headers are handled and the fact that I picked a low contrast color for my links. I'll fix it soon.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-and-where-im-going-next">Conclusion and where I'm going next</h3>
<p>Overall, I'm happy with this version of the site and blogging about it has helped me think about what places I want to refine going forward. </p>
<h4 id="list-of-things-to-improve">List of things to improve</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a decent readme with all the packages and properties that the theme uses</li>
<li>Improve color contrast for reading</li>
<li>Add Cristian Prieto's <a href="https://github.com/cprieto/mdx_downheader">mdx_downheader</a></li>
<li>Make the top navigation a little less clunky</li>
<li>Look into how to integrate micro.blog posts</li>

<p>I found a desk near the garbage bin and I wanted even though I didn't have room for it. I guess it's because I still love the idea of sitting down and getting to work on something. </p>

<p>I feel that it’s party because of the restlessness I get every once in a while where I want to make or learn something. I think I’m really making progress in keeping my eye on the ball and making sure to reflect on my goals. </p>

<p>Work has been really busy and weird at the same time. A lot of unanswered questions and unease just below the surface. I hope there isn’t any extra drama...</p>

<p>Today, I thought about how I start most of my post with the word "today". If you look through all of my writings on this blog you probably won't find it because it's usually the first thing that I delete when I'm editing.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because some part of me is always thinking about how I want to start or continue something and that <em>Today</em> will be the day that everything will work out and I can start down easy street.</p>
<p>It hasn't happened but I feel that life is filled with stops and starts and as long as you focus on making some progress everyday - even if it's a little - that feeling of <em>Today</em> goes away.</p>

<p><img alt="Looking back there were 4 main areas. Performance being the first." src="images/WWDC-2018.png"></p>
<p>My first feeling about the keynote is genuine happiness. I'm happy that they are going to focus on the performance of the operating system. I'm happy that they are supporting all the devices that were working with iOS 11. I'm also happy that they are <strong>NOT</strong> introducing a lot of extraneous<sup id="fnref:extra"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:extra">1</a></sup> features that people may never use.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-performance">Focus on performance</h3>
<p>I'm tired of people having problems with Apple devices. I'm the family tech support and I do <em>not</em> like the feeling of having someone's device not work. This is compounded when I'm usually the one who recommends them. </p>
<p>I'm hoping that this will allow me to not have to answer as many questions and make the current devices last longer. I can't afford to buy anything new at this point.</p>
<h3 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h3>
<p>I am already on board the automation train. I've got the <a href="https://www.workflow.is">workflow</a> and <a href="https://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">launch center pro</a> applications on my phone. I feel that this should allow me and everyone else a better way of getting rid of repetitive tasks.</p>
<h3 id="bring-developers-back-to-the-mac-app-store">Bring developers back to the Mac App Store</h3>
<p>I'll believe it when I see it, but it definitely gives me the warm fuzzies to have developers feel more at ease on the platforms that I love.</p>
<h3 id="apple-watch">Apple Watch</h3>
<p>I think this is the best presentation that I've seen with Kevin Lynch. I would like an Apple watch, but I have trouble thinking about how I'd incorporate it into my life. When I saw those demos along with everything else associated with iOS 12, I found myself dreaming about owning one again<sup id="fnref:again"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:again">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All in all, I'm happy with the keynote and actually a little sad that people weren't. It really feels like Apple is sitting down and letting their products mature a little more as they move forward.</p>

<p>I've been rewatching Westworld with my wife. It's been fun seeing how there are hints of what's to come throughout the first season. I don't know how much the writers really had planned, but it's so much fun to think that something is going to happen and then seeing something completely different.</p>
<p>It's also exciting to see my wife come up with her own theories and see the wonder on her face. These are the good times.</p>
