<h2>Me:</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Mandaris Moore. I'm this guy... you know... Anyway, I've been messing around on the internet for a while. I'm interested in a lot of things; mac programming, accessible web design and self improvement.</p>
<p><em>Self improvement</em> For most of my life, I've been plagued with low self-esteem and questions about who I am and what I want to do with my time on this planet. In recent years I've narrowed my goals to the following priorities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be a good father</li>
<li>Be the best person I can be</li>
</ol>
<p>The second goal feed into the first but it's important that I put the children first.</p>
<h2>Site:</h2>
<p>This site used to be hosted on Google's blogger, but with recent changes in how people communicate on the internet, I wanted more control over my voice on the web. I know that a lot of people enjoy social media sites such as twitter and facebook, but I wanted to have a place where my long form thoughts can be all my own.</p>
<p>The site design is based off of the beginner's tutorial created by <a href="http://www.quotidianquest.com">Merlin Rebrović</a> for the <a href="http://hyde.github.com">Hyde project</a>. It is included in Hyde as a layout named <em>starter</em>.
If you have a <a href="http://hyde.github.com/install.html">default Hyde installation</a>, all you have to do is
write:</p>
<pre><code>hyde -s folder_name create -l starter
</code></pre>
<p>To check for the newest version, to download it separately or to report
a bug, please visit Hyde Starter Kit's <a href="https://github.com/merlinrebrovic/hyde-starter-kit">GitHub page</a>.</p>        </section>
