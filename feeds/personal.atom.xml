&lt;p&gt;Today, I was listening and I head a song that asked a simple question&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you happy where your life is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't hear that question on other stations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="music"></category></entry><entry><title>An accomplishment</title><link href="/2013/10/an-accomplishment.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-10-13T22:50:29-07:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2013-10-13:2013/10/an-accomplishment.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've had a little idea going on in the back of my head for the last couple of months about a simple application that would pop up after a given keyboard shortcut. It's a simple idea and never got around to doing it because I didn't sit down and do it. Even on the days, where I thought "Hey,If I had an easy way to keep track of all the good things that I've done, I'd feel better about myself". Normally, I just look at the todo item that I had in OmniFocus and just push it back a couple days or weeks because of priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today, I sat down and decided that if I wanted to really follow my own words about controlling my life I've got to make good on the commitments that I make to myself big or small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I sat down behind my laptop opened up my AppleScript 1-2-3&lt;sup id="fnref:unused"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:unused" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and started searching the internet after not seeing a solution to my problems on the first page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;theSumm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;returned&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dialog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Latest Accomplishment&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;buttons&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;OK&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;A step forward&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;OK&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;application&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Calendar&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;make&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;todo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;todos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;calendar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Accomplishments&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;properties&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;theSumm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;completion&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;current&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tell&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At first, I was just going to put this in a script file and then run it from a service, but I decided that the easiest way of doing this was to use &lt;a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/" title="An app that I've been using more and more to get things moving quickly."&gt;Keyboard Maestro&lt;/a&gt;. It was really cool that I got to move the entire script into the application so I didn't have to move between the different applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mandaris/10540756656/" title="A screenshot of my first keyboard maestro attempt to make a short cut to log my accomplishments"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3783/10540756656_0d7bd92af3.jpg" width="427" height="500" alt="A copy of my first keyboard maestro attempt to make a short cut to log my accomplishments"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I had originally envisioned, but I started to think about the limitations of keeping all of this in reminders. All the applications that use the system built &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/apps/#reminders" title="The default todo application on Mac OSX"&gt;task management tools&lt;/a&gt; have a focus on what needs to be done and if I want to have way to look at this stuff quickly and I wasn't sure how to look at accomplishments that were marked as completed a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a look at what I was doing on a daily basis and saw that I've been doing more and more journaling using &lt;a href="http://dayoneapp.com" title="Day One is a great simple application that allows you to have a journal that syncs with all my devices"&gt;Day One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:dayoneshortcut"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dayoneshortcut" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't want to make the Day One application open up every time that I finished something new so I looked at the &lt;a href="http://dayoneapp.com/tools/cli-man/" title="Day One command line interface"&gt;command line interface&lt;/a&gt; and came up with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mandaris/10543020504/" title="Screenshot of my keyboard maestro macro to log accomplishments quickly using the command line interface for Day One"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5487/10543020504_5edfa7b7ba.jpg" width="387" height="500" alt="Screenshot of my keyboard maestro macro to log accomplishments quickly using the command line interface for Day One"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the only downside is that I have to go into Day One to make all the hashtags turn into tags and I have to do a search for that tag if I want to see all my accomplishments in a given time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think for the next iteration, I might set up &lt;a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/" title="GeekTool: A tool to show information from files and commands on the desktop"&gt;GeekTool&lt;/a&gt; to show my latest accomplishment on my desktop, but I'm just happy that I finished this initial task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:unused"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought this &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Training-AppleScript-1-2-3-ebook/dp/B000SEI7EO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1381753150&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=applescript+1-2-3"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; almost a year ago so that I could start teaching myself to do more automation on my computer. Turns out, I just needed to take the time and focus on something that I really wanted to create. It felt good and I think I'll actually get through it... when I get the time.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:unused" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:dayoneshortcut"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd already had a specific keyboard shortcut for opening up the menubar pop up for quick writing of thoughts and feelings, but I didn't want to add a &lt;a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html" title="Textexpander is a tool that I use when I'm writing things over and over again."&gt;textexpander&lt;/a&gt; snippet to add an accomplishment tag.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:dayoneshortcut" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

I was told to only write two sentences but I made three so that I could delete a paragraph later. I thought it would be ok to post them on my site. I hope that you get something out of reading it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a little bit of a perfectionist when it comes to my work. I find myself agonizing over details and often have multiple drafts and versions of emails, code examples and tutorials that I'm going to publish right after I change that one or two critical things that will make my point. This has been one of the reasons that I've been in Quality Assurance for as long as I have; I don't want people to run into problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started working, I was put in charge of creating and automating test suites for an application development tool. The mission was to simulate how a user would create a smaller application using the different components and options available. I quickly learned that automation is only good if you have a clear goal of what you want to accomplish. When the automation breaks, something should happen other than changing the automation. Since then, I've worked with a variety of systems that reported an issue when something goes wrong, either a problem in the build system or a change in functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of companies are attempting to be agile and it is important that a QA engineer keep up to date with where the company wants to go with the product and have an idea for how people are actually going to be using it. I've been in a couple of situations where companies have been so focused on the features of the product, that they loose track of how everything is supposed to come together for the user. There can be difficulty in communicating (development in remote parts of the world or just don't see it the same way), but I feel that I've learned a lot of different ways of getting my point across (detailed bug reports, screenshots and videos) and understanding where other people are coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In your current role, what is the end product? How do you test it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my current role, I test two products. One is a web portal that I test using selenium for regressions and manual testing following test plans that I've developed. The other is an IDE based off of eclipse which creates smaller applications that I do manual testing using test plans that I've created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do you have experience with imbedded software? Please describe?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the closest I've come to a truly imbedded system is when I was working at Intel and I had to run data through a simulation of the graphics chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is your experience with programming?  Languages? Years of experience? What have you programmed for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always been active in keeping my skills up. I've been doing java for about 8 years now and use it mainly for creating examples for customers and components within my test plans. I've used objective-c for 4 years and use it for my own personal applications. I've been getting more and more into python for the last 2 years as a way to automate my mac, generate test data and small web services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have you been a member of a SCRUM team? Describe your sprints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, most of them are related to creating and merging a major feature into the software. The team had to design and implement new features that could make the software unstable, I was in charge of merge conflicts and regression testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is your experience with defect tracking systems. Where did you do this and what was the project?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't imagine a world where there isn't some kind of defect tracking system! I've used RedMine, Jira, Salesforce and a couple built by the the company (Intel and Apple). At Unify, we used Salesforce to track customer issues and information. If there was a real bug or enhancement, we'd put it into Jira or a terminal based bug tracker and each person was told to make sure that all the information needed for a bug was completely documented and were to place test artifacts. At Intel and Apple, we used a custom built solution that required us to put the examples and test artifacts on a shared drive. At Intel, we also had to schedule time on simulator in order to reproduce and debug problems. At Starview, we use RedMine to document and prioritize issues as they come up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Describe your experience with source control systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've used CVS, RCS, Subversion, git and mercurial. At intel, we used subversion to branch and merge bug features and bug fixes. It was my primary duty to handle these merges. The most difficult merge had to do with over 25 files and thousands of lines of code. At Starview, they use mercurial and I use the command line to interact with that. I use git to check out source control from Github. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Describe your experience with automated testing tools. What have you used? Where? For how long? In what context.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first tool that used was SilkTest as Unify, I used it for 2 years. At Intel, they had a system called Tambor that ran tests in an emulator (not to be confused with the simulator from earlier) part of the regression testing was running Tambor. Currently, I've been using Jenkins to start automated tasks when there is a change in source code. Jenkins kicks off tasks such as selenium to test how the application respond to user input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is your experience with integration test planning approaches and related experience with:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;regression testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, we add a test to the automated suite based off the the severity of the bug and all critical issues are added to the test plan for manual testing. Usually, this is broken down as use cases and there is a lot of over lap. For example, a new feature might be introduced (i.e when users click and hold a button a different event is triggered) and we have to make sure that the new functionality doesn't change how it used to work unexpectedly. I've had to write the plans that describe how it is supposed to be used and the code that would actually do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;acceptance testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my current position, we noticed a problem where things started to feel slower when using the application. We didn't have any real data on how to see if there was a problem other than noticing that our automation suite was taking longer to run. I took it upon myself to learn and implement jmeter and look at serval plugins for jenkins so that we can look at the performance of different test from one build to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;risk based testing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually see this as part of regression testing because of time and resource limitations. If you are able to grow your suite of tests, you can focus on making sure that new features and bug fixes get higher priority for test creation. That being said, the new stuff is usually tested manually so that I can get a feel for what it is doing versus the documented requirements.

And it looks like a lot of people have a strong reaction to this. Her sponsor has dropped her and even the food network has severed her ties with her. "People" -I use the term loosely- are going back on forth on forums about how it's unfair to do this to her because some of the best selling rappers use the word like a particle of speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think the outrage is too much. Doing this isn't helping race relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;History?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to give you a history lesson on the N-word. Most people in America already know what it means. If you don't know what it means, take some time and watch &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075572"&gt;Roots&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853728"&gt;Django Unchained&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can think about are my own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My experiences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;People yelling it out of cars&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the times that I've heard the N-word shouted at me was when I had someone drive past me and yell the word from a moving vehicle. I've had people throw things at me as they were doing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One instance was when our neighbor's boyfriend had yelled it at me after I had threatened to call the cops on him for yelling at his girlfriend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these people knew anything about me other than I was black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Children Yelling at Each Other&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when I take my kids to the park I hear some of the younger kids say it to each other. Sometime to intimidate and anger each other and other times as a general insult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes see how some of the children will gang up on the other and use it in hopes that the one being teased (usually a smaller kid and never the largest) will fight back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the kids are mimicking TV or just there life at home and feel sad for them that this is what they do when their parents are around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Entertainment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy a lot of things, like music and movies. One of my favorite things to do is to watch a movie or listen to some stand up. In fact, some of my favorite comedians are Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three of them have had jokes that can be considered derogatory&lt;sup id="fnref:unfunny"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:unfunny" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to movies, a lot of the "black films" that I've seen in recent years have had the phrase "Nigga, please" or some kind of derivative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a couple times, when I've had "discussions" with my parents about how I don't "talk black".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conference&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the most memorable use of the N-word that I've heard happened when I was at a NSBE conference back in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker had painted an image of how a group of runaway slaves had been captured by some kind of bounty hunters and how some of them were going to be killed as an example. One of the runaways had just given birth and was pleading to be spared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slaver shot her dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then stomped the baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And said "Nigger".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if it was less than trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a powerful image, because it hit me that the N-word is the same word people would use to kill as to chide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes no sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do other races see it that bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if other races, think about words used for them. And honestly, I've only know a couple. Most notably mexicans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What are we going to do?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, we can all jump to arms and point fingers, but I doubt that is going to help anyone out in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't hide it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel we all need to be a little more open to the fact that people are going to say things that we don't like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And honestly, there are people out there that even the worst words are too good for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is up to all of us to be a little understanding and let people express themselves&lt;sup id="fnref:DontBeStupid"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:DontBeStupid" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to a degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, how are they going to learn? And how are we going to know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a long way to go in race relations. I consider myself very lucky to be in America and even more lucky to be in California. I know we've made huge strides in equality and learning to live with other ethnic groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there is more to this case than just the N-word. The lawsuit that brought this to light talks about other forms of harassment and I think that as human beings we should focus on that in regards to Paula Deen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:unfunny"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this might actually be why Eddie Murphy doesn't do stand up any more. I went back and listened to some of his earlier stuff and shook my head to hear how many "faggot" jokes he used to say.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:unfunny" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The (in)famous pancake breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an activity that they told us about at the very beginning of the school year (6 months ago) and I’ve honestly have been kind of dreading that this day would come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not so much volunteering to do it as it is getting the parents to help out. Although our school has a policy where every parent is required to volunteer 40 hours over the entire school year or donate 20 bucks per hour, I feel that not everyone is able to jump on board and help support us with this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not angry and I understand that not everyone can help this week, but since I’m the one who is responsible for this if it fails...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m just happy that the class that my daughter is in has a lot of top notch parents who really want this to succeed and understand that even the little bit of help can go a long way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially if you tell me about it so I don’t go crazy thinking about what could go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing of personal note is that all the stress of the pancake breakfast has gotten me back in front of the computer to write again.

&lt;p&gt;She’s good at it and I love doing it with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it’s great.:
Which is actually turning into a question because we’ve been having a couple of issues in the bedroom. Sometime it great and sometime both of us are left laying there unsatisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I’m not the only one this has happened to. A multimillion dollar industry is aimed at couples, women and men trying to improve what they have in the bed room or at the very least make &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve done a couple things like read books, play games and even watch a movie or two, but I’m coming to the conclusion that we are missing that little spark that used to set us off. Sure, we have are little sessions here and there but I feel that we’ve drifted apart in some ways and it doesn’t feel like we are making love to each other but only attempting to satisfy our desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do we do that? How do I take the woman who nurtures my kids and kisses there owies and do all the little things I wanted to do when we were dating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it me? Am I the one who is having trouble identifying that woman I married as the same woman who I couldn’t get the clothes off fast enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of it is that I can’t get my mind on all the thoughts about being in adequate and into the moment where it is just two people trying to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the kids wake up.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="marriage"></category></entry><entry><title>Just when it gets good…</title><link href="/2012/08/just-when-it-gets-good.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-08-28T22:34:22-07:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-08-28:2012/08/just-when-it-gets-good.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It seems like everything things get good between my wife and I things seem to fall apart. I don't know what it is but it feels like the problem I'm having with my mom. I.E. things go well and then &lt;strong&gt;GRRRRRR&lt;/strong&gt; we're silently fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid that I married my mom in that regard. I've married someone who's default behavior is something akin to a wild animal. Even when you think she's pretty tamed, she'll rear back and swipe at you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that isn't even the worst part about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst part is that there are very rarely moments where I feel that she even notices it herself or feels that she maybe in the wrong. When we talk about it. I usually hear "you do it too" as if makes it right and a brush off that the argument is over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel blooded and scared over it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about the story of the scorpion and the frog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scorpion and a frog meet on the bank of a stream and the 
scorpion asks the frog to carry him across on its back. The 
frog asks, "How do I know you won't sting me?" The scorpion 
says, "Because if I do, I will die too."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frog is satisfied, and they set out, but in midstream,
the scorpion stings the frog. The frog feels the onset of 
paralysis and starts to sink, knowing they both will drown,
but has just enough time to gasp "Why?" &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replies the scorpion: "Its my nature..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is our nature, maybe it is something being blown out of proportion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you felt your relationship was sinking, what would you do?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="relationships"></category><category term="marriage"></category></entry><entry><title>Loosing touch</title><link href="/2012/07/loosing-touch.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-07-23T23:48:32-07:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-07-23:2012/07/loosing-touch.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I really feel like I'm loosing touch with my daughters. Part of me thinks that I maybe overthinking the fact that I've been a little sick and out of it the last couple of days, but another part is worried about the health of the communication between me and my 4 year old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I wrote that I thought to myself, 'How can any one unstand the mind of a 4 year old?'. Well, there are books on it so maybe something is there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using your big girl words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, it feels that our daughters are both not communicating in the best possible way. Both of them seem to yell and whine more than they used to and I find myself thinking that this might be my fault since they are home more. The last couple of weeks have seen the family move into a pattern where things aren't really moving as in a healthy way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's the lack of sleep or the fact that mommy and daddy have had more and more conflict where we aren't talking to each other in a respectful way and the children sometimes hear us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's the fact that our dog died and this is part of the grieving process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever it is, we have to figure it out and find a way for us as a family to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

At first I had my own reservations about taking the furniture in because of all the invisible strings attached to something like that&lt;sup id="fnref:mama_drama"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mama_drama" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was told that it was going to be a simple set of headboards, drawers and a desk with a little book shelf on top. In truth, the furniture was a lot different then what we were expecting as far as shape, size and quality. It's the older kind of furniture, the kind that can last and be moved from one home to another without falling apart along the way. It looked like it could take a beating and from some of the scratches and scraps it looked like it already had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the wife decided that we should paint it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this turned into a weekend long project where we spent most of our time outside in the sun putting multiple coats of white and pink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just when we finish up and show our children. How do they react?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't like taking things from people because they sometimes expect you to reciprocate in a way that I don't feel warrants a particular action. I'm grateful for everything, but it feels like sometimes there is an unspoken contract and a payment that is beyond what I'm willing to do.

When we see each other, we get a chance to talk about our own grievances and help cheer each other on as we make our way towards are respective goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I've been playing with the idea of doing affirmations and spending time everyday writing out 5 things that I'm excited/happy about as well as grateful for&lt;sup id="fnref:grateful"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:grateful" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for my friend, I don't know all the things that he is doing to relieve stress and just move forward with his life. I kind of just want to give him a big hug and tell him that it's going to be alright, but I know that isn't going to be enough. It isn't enough for me either and when it comes to stuff like this, you have make your own choices on how you are going to make yourself a better person.&lt;/p&gt;

Was the subject of what we were fighting over so big that we have to go through this? Do the highs of our relationship really outweigh the lows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of me tells me to just relax  because this is part of what relationships are about. Highs and lows. We've been having some rough spots because I've lost my job and the money has gotten a lot tighter&lt;sup id="fnref:tighter"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tighter" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We both have our expectations of what should and shouldn't be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another part of me is angry at the world. Angry at where I am. Angry at myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was having a fairly good day and I didn't want to walk into that familiar routine of being &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; punching bag. I'm tired of taking other people's &lt;code&gt;redacted&lt;/code&gt; and I dumped it back on her with other stuff as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then she just laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where I went wrong. I got angry. I got very angry and said that I sometimes don't like coming home to her because of her attitude. I might have said some other stuff too. I don't remember all of it, but I'm sure she'll remind&lt;sup id="fnref:remember"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:remember" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went for a walk before it got bigger. I came home. We didn't look at each other. She took the girls. We slept in separate rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm sitting at a coffee shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might as well be sitting in the middle of Antarctica for all the distance and coldness between us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:tighter"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real rub about this is that even though I'm unemployed, I still make more than her via unemployment insurance. This has allowed us to appear that we are doing alright, but I feel the strain of it. We're living &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/9iCd6UHR-3I" title="Still Fly"&gt;hood rich&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:tighter" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't had any exercise in a while and it was great to get out of my head and hit the dusty trail... which actually isn't dusty because it's paved. Although I do enjoy the benefits of running, I don't really enjoy it. I don't get a thrill of having the wind in my hair or seeing the scenery change as I speed along the paths and trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'm not going that fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I plan on going to my first yoga class at a local studio and I'm pretty excited about it. It's a new way of caring for myself and I have to make that a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speaking of making myself a priority&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've typed up a new list of affirmations for myself, but I'm honestly afraid to put them in a place that I can see them every day. I've played with the idea of making a script to pop them up when I first log into my computer in the morning, but that time usually changes depending on what I'm doing that day. I've also thought about putting them up in the bathroom, but I'm embarrassed about how I would explain that to my children and afraid that my wife might say something about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at that last sentence and thought, 'Hey, I can't live that way. If I'm going to make myself a better person, I need to do this for me.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were being judged and they were going to heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

As will all my new tools it was great for getting thoughts down and being able to read them over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only major problem I had was that I could put it in my pocket and just leave right away, I had to have some kind of bag or give up a free hand in order to carry it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that my daughters see it and think "Hey, it drawing time" and now it's halfway filled with their little snippets of stories and artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

She has gone from being an avid reader to coming home and asking for it as soon as she steps through the door. Sometimes she even asks for it as we drive up to our home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of me is proud about how she has mastered moving around on the device. I've sometimes seen her start a movie in Netflix or watching things on YouTube. My wife loves telling her co-workers how our daughters can do things that some adults have difficulty doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is part of the problem. My daughter &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do things other adult have trouble doing. Things like place an item into an Amazon shopping cart and proceed to the check out, find "special" offers on Disney  merchandise and then place her personal information in one of the forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I've been lucky that she hasn't ordered hunders of books and horse toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of this problem is that she's grown rather fond of a series of fan fiction trailers about the Lion King. Although at first glance there isn't anything wrong with seeing how people can take something and make it so much more. When she run over to me and says that certain characters share a different relationship and lineage that I feel is &lt;em&gt;kosher&lt;/em&gt; that's when I got to step on the breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe, part of this is my fault for pushing technology and all it's wonderful whizz bangs without giver her some kind of limitations. But the geek in my wanted to see what she could do if she were to explore on her own. The part of me that says "you must always be a vigilant parent" lost to the part of that wants to let her be free and a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what makes this part bitter sweet. I know the world isn't filled with magical talking animals. My daughter knows this too. But there is no need to disillusion her to the good in people and the good of moral character. She doesn't need to worry about wether Simba and Nala are really first cousins. She doesn't need to worry about a whole bunch of books showing up that she needs to pay for. She shouldn't worry about meeting some stranger on the internet. She needs to just have fun and be a kid.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="tech"></category><category term="parenting"></category></entry><entry><title>A life filled with life</title><link href="/2012/05/a-life-filled-with-life.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-01T22:50:48-07:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-05-01:2012/05/a-life-filled-with-life.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I feel that one of my greatest weaknesses is that I underestimate myself and my abilities.

&lt;li&gt;Not good enough to be a writer, so I never took the time to write.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not good enough to be a dancer, so I never pursued competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not good enough to make it as a programmer, so I never submitted an application to anyone other than teachers and close friends and afterward I never bothered to save my own code.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is only when I stop myself and look at all the little things that I do and make a daily list of accomplishments that I find the strength say, "Yes, I can and did."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say life is made up of little things, and it is up to all of us to find the little things in life that will move us forward. &lt;/p&gt;

I think I might even place it back onto NearlyFreeSpeech.net again because they had one of the easier ways of hosting and I didn't have to worry about forwarding the www.quotidianquest.com&lt;sup id="fnref:www"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:www" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

I don't review it often enough to trust it and I find myself letting things fall by the way side. I think I'm going to focus on getting things out of my mind and dedicating time on my calendar to review things at the beginning and end of the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the first words that I can think of as I stare at the computer trying to come up with something write about for today. It's not that I don't know what I'll be doing&lt;sup id="fnref:doing"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:doing" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but what am I going to be thinking about when I do it. Will I be worried about when my next paycheck is going to come in or am I going to happy that we just finished another birthday party for the kids. Will I have to worry about whether or not I have to put the dog down because he's been having some digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been looking for ways to not get into a rut since loosing my job almost a month ago. All I can think of is the worry about what my next step is going to be and how horrible it will be if such and such doesn't happen for me. Almost none of my energy has gone into making things happen for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It almost feels like I'm catatonic, or a ghost standing over my own body and watching as time and life just slip by me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only good news is that I feel that I'm finally slipping through some of the fog and actually moving forward with some things again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like with a lot of things in life, the first step is the hardest.&lt;/p&gt;

They say that if momma ain't happy then no one is&lt;sup id="fnref:momma"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:momma" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but -other than the occasional rough spot brought by the fact that she's in pain and can't eat- it's pretty smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it's given me more opportunities to interact with the girls and show them that I can be just as fun as mommy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, my youngest usually screams like a banshee when we clean her hair, but we turned it into a fun game where she got to play with the shower head and squirt around the bath tub. Both of them liked it and we didn't have to clean up buckets of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Working Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had my second workout at innovative fitness but I think that it could have been better. Most of the exercises are new to me and I'm spending more of my time focusing on the technique versus pushing myself a little bit harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My knees have been hurting me when I do lunges and the exercises that the couch has been throwing at us has some kind of lunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that it might be what's holding me back. I'm scared of pain. I don't want to hurt myself, but it made me think about all the times that I didn't push myself because it hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

I do respect and love my father, but sometimes I see the scars that life has given him. There are moments where I see the bitterness seeping out of him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I lived in his house for more than half of my life, there are many things I don't know about him. I don't know all the troubles he lived through and there have been times when I've wondered why does he feel a certain way about different things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been many times that he's ranted about something and I've thought he was crazy. The thing is that's I feel that he's right to a degree, but the way he talks about it doesn't help his argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, I don't know much about my father outside of being &lt;em&gt;my father&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is important?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it important that I know everything about my dad before he became my dad? No. The important thing is that he loves me and that I can trust him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons I think about this is that I wonder if he is happy. Is he proud of the majority of his choices in life and whether he's accomplished all of the goals that were truly important to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are we going anywhere with this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many times in my life where I've forgotten that how many sibilings that my parent have and what's their names are. I do know that my father has a brother... His name in John. I don't know if it's Jon, Jonathan or John... For a couple of years I thought it was Robert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was driving in the car with my family and I mentioned my brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My oldest daughter asked, "You got a brother?"&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="family"></category></entry><entry><title>Teeth and projects</title><link href="/2012/03/teeth-and-projects.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-09T21:55:59-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-03-09:2012/03/teeth-and-projects.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My wife had her wisdom teeth pulled today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, things are going to be cheery around here. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent most of the day just caring for her or watching her sleep. It was kind of nice because it took me back to the early days of our relationship when I would just sit and stare as she slept. Natasha thought it was kind of creepy, but for me it was a rare moment of seeing her at peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've prioritized my tech projects to two major things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The website&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've taken my website down because I didn't like the direction (or lack thereof) it was taking. I originally had a lot of different ideas that I wanted to do, but got stuck with the tools on making it versus making the content the king. I've placed a holding page up for now while I come up with what the next step is going to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't decided on whether I should move to a service lie calipin or just throw everything out and start completely from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Re-starting my career&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not happy with where I am and have decided that I need to start over from the very begining as far as my career is concerned. I'd like to take what I know about computer science and just go over all the little things that made me take the subject from the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On how to do this, I've been putting a plan together that focuses more on the how of computer science and "going deep" versus the why.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="wife"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Books and Job Hunting</title><link href="/2012/03/books-and-job-hunting.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-08T15:40:03-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-03-08:2012/03/books-and-job-hunting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, today I was thinking about all the things I would like to do. Sometimes it feels like I have the entire world on my shoulders and I fight the urge to attempt to do everything at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to take a second to think about what the most important thing is at this moment and do it to the best of my ability. It times like this, I go back to OmniFocus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I attempted to ship a book[^book] that I had placed on Amazon. Amazon was going to give me 3 bucks to ship it and all the shipping options that USPS offered were 4 dollars or more. I like the idea of sharing knowledge but I seriously don't want to donate my money and time in this fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Job Hunting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been looking for a job on dice.com and it strikes me as interesting on how different job postings can be. Some of them are very simple and might as well be the equivelent of a "Help Wanted" sign while others might have 30 or more requirements in order to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my last interview, the person I spoke with was actually surprised that I read the psoting and job description. Which got me thinking about the hotgun versus snipper rifle approach to job hunting. Do you focus on getting as many résumé out there or do you make a custom one for every kind of position and a different covers letters for every position?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="jobs"></category><category term="goals"></category></entry><entry><title>App Store Reviews and Sweat</title><link href="/2012/03/app-store-reviews-and-sweat.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-07T22:45:15-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-03-07:2012/03/app-store-reviews-and-sweat.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight, I wrote a review for &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monopoly-hotels/id479412611?mt=8"&gt;MONOPOLY Hotels&lt;/a&gt;, because I was wanted to rant against what I see as a societal evil. Here it is below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard for me to understand why some many other people like this game so much. Haven't we all learned the lessons of freemium? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game starts off free, but in the end it become a very long grind where the only way to make some kind of progress is to pay money for "gold". There is no way that you hard work can balance against that kind of thing and if you spent that much time doing it, just think about what you could have been doing with that time and energy…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a hint: Maybe make your own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oooo! Harsh, I know. You can actually see society changing as you read every character, but I think the ending is the most important. I would like to see a game that was fun and rewarded players for the hard work that they do but still let those who want to "win" do so. I think I'll spend the next couple of days working on some prototypes to see how much work it would take to make something like this come to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fitness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was my first time in the gym all year... and maybe all of last year too and I have to say that it was great. I went to innovative fitness and conditioning and it almost seemed like I was having my own personal trainer... that I shared... with 6 people. &lt;em&gt;BUT&lt;/em&gt; I don't think I could have done all the exercises on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, not at this point in my life. I've grown sedentary but going to the gym has really made me want to pursue a more healthier me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that could be the exhaustion talking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still&lt;/em&gt;, my wife says that I seem really happy after doing it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="reviews"></category><category term="exercise"></category></entry><entry><title>The bed doesn't rock</title><link href="/2012/03/the-bed-doesnt-rock.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-06T22:13:36-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-03-06:2012/03/the-bed-doesnt-rock.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this one in bed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the first time for that, but this time is weird. My wife and I haven't said anything beyond "Can I sleep here?" and "If you want to".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to chalk this up as a result of stress on the both of us after the contract my contract ended. Plus I have some more bad news, I didn't get a job that I really wanted after doing two interviews. I honestly felt that I was a shoe in for the position, so I'm really disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about starting some kind of video blog of my progress on how I attempt to find employment and talked about it with my friend, Nick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing he asked me was if I had ever thought about doing a kickstarter to get a business going and what it would be. It was then, that I told him about a half thought about what I would do if I couldn't find a job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to meet up tomorrow and talk about what things we can do moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Working out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, I start working out at intence fitness and I'm a little worried about how it is going to turn out. I haven't been to the gym in years and this is promising to be a unique experence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going because I have a one month voucher, but I don't know if I'll be staying because... well, I don't have a job. Plus the place doesn't seem to be that proffesional. I called them twice on Monday and didn't get a call back until 4pm that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="relationships"></category><category term="fitness"></category></entry><entry><title>auto repair</title><link href="/2012/03/auto-repair.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-05T22:34:46-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-03-05:2012/03/auto-repair.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm not a fan of automotive repair. My first memorys of doing it was me attempting to help my dad work on something on the car. He'd be under there sweating and grunting as he changed the oil and then ask me to go and fetch something from his usually  disorganized&lt;sup id="fnref:disorganized"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:disorganized" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; workbench. Unfortunately, it seemed like no matter how quick I was it wasn't quick enough or the part was exactly what he wanted. I understand that it could be frustrating to wait underneath a car in the middle of the summer, but you'd think you'd be a little more prepared (i.e. have the tools ready) for a job that you've done every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don't want to sound ungrateful that my dad wanted make sure that I had some of the basic man skills, because there have been more than a couple times that I've had to change a tire, jump start a car or countless other little things that have popped up over the years. The only drawback is that working on cars with my dad has really left a bad impression on me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don't like it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cringe when it comes down to the maintenance of it all. I'm willfully and woefully ignorant with it comes to anything beyond the basic maintance. I cry a little bit inside everytime that I have to bring my car into a maintenance shop. When I'm with my other no-car people friends, we complain that there aren't any honest mechanics out there that we can trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, I've run into a few who are honest, but they tend to either lose there job (drinking, divorce) or no longer able to work on it (it's complicated). It's shortly after those times that I wish I had taken a class or two on automotive repair. Not only to stop myself from getting ripped off, but to show my dad that I could do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe that's a different issue all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:disorganized"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad had a workbench in the garage that he constantly was adding and re-arranging tools on. It was one of those "I know exactly where everything is and if you couldn't find it, someone else must have moved it". After a while, we all learned that this wasn't always the case.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:disorganized" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I think it is because of the way that I see the world. When I was younger, it felt like I was an outsider looking in. I could almost see the connections between people as threads and see how what one person could effect another. I remember feeling alone in this because none of the connections to me seemed to be that strong. I made a conscience decision to focus more on being in the world instead of just looking at it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that I've made some really good connections with other people, but I don't know if I ever forgot the feeling and viewpoint of looking at the world in that way. There is a part of me that looks at the way people treat each other and says, "No matter what I say, that person is going to treat that other person like shit". But maybe that's all part of growing up; seeing that we can't change everybody and that being able to recognize that people must make their own decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a wife and kids, I find myself dreading going back to that outlook with them. Sometimes, I feel that I'm only watching them as opposed to living with them. I've been making more time for those I love to tell them that I love them and that I'm proud of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because, they are the most prized connections that I have.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="relationships"></category></entry><entry><title>doubts and a plan</title><link href="/2012/03/doubts-and-a-plan.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-02T23:21:11-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-03-02:2012/03/doubts-and-a-plan.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is the second day that I've been without a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it's due to the end of the contract, I still feel kind of lost. That was my first contract, and it's weird to look back and think that even though I knew it was going to end... it still ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, if you had asked me last week whether or not I was feeling confident about what my next step was going to be, I'd tell you that I'm walking forward to the next phase in my career, but --thanks to a lot of little doubts placed by those closest to me-- I no longer feel so warm and fuzzy inside. I constantly hear "It's hard out there", "What's your plan?" and even the contractor who is replacing me was out of work for a year before he found something&lt;sup id="fnref:something"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:something" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Which has caused me to stay up tonight to write this down, get it out of my system and onto my &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/56"&gt;filesystem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The fear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fear is that I won't find some kind of employment soon. In my mind, I have constant questions floating around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I could never find someone to hire me again?&lt;br /&gt;
What would I do to make income?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parent in me jumps up and screams "I'd do anything to make sure that my family is happy and well taken care of", but I can't feed a family on good intentions and I'm not the kind of person to go out and rob others. Although, I have started looking around the house for things that we can sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan or desire at this point, is to take the next couple of days thinking about what I really would like to do if I wanted to run my own business. In case, I don't get a phone call on Monday-Tuesday, what would I like to do to bring in the money. I'm not going to fool myself that I'm going to make something over night, but I'd certainly like to spend more time on making something other than comments on other people's blog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I want to move from wantabe to somebody in a lot of areas in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:something"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought the idea of being a contractor was awesome. Employers like to think of you as kind of a hired gun; you come in do the job and leave. After doing it a year and talking to the other contractors and some of the people who used to be contractors, I now think of it as being a prostitute with the old joke that you don't pay a prostitute for sex, you pay them to leave. A lot of people seem ok with the idea that we are hired with the idea of being replaced and with the economy and globalization being what it is, I can't find too much fault with companies doing that.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:something" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I'm nervous. Today, I had an interview and it was really very difficult for me to express myself in the most positive light. The guy kept asking me questions about where I stood as far as the support structure at my last place of employment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really brought all those old feeling all over again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did I do wrong?&lt;br /&gt;

Where am I going?
Who am I now that I can't provide for my family?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all that I tried to find the best answers for the problems and finally I said that if they truly wanted to know how I was as a worker they can contact some of my references. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife says that was a good answer and I honestly believe her because the guy stopped asking questions after that and we moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Last Days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was also the beginning of the last week working at Intel and -to tell the truth- the last month has been really difficult for me. In addition to the stress and worry of finding another source of employment, I've had to spend all of this month training the person who will be replacing me. Honestly, I've been trying to get him up and running but he's been running into a number of problems related to permissions and other little gotchas along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish him the best and I see a lot of new and exciting opportunities for him going forward.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="employement"></category></entry><entry><title>New Opportunities</title><link href="/2012/02/new-opportunities.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-21T19:30:54-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-02-21:2012/02/new-opportunities.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I got a phone call for a job interview on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's certainly better to have something going for me in that regard, I've been having trouble focusing on what my next step in life is going to be and was in danger of just freezing up. I feel that even if I don't get a job the fact that I'm going to have an interview makes me feel confident to go out and put my résumé in all kinds of places that I didn't think to put them before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the point about a finding a new job, the position actually sounds like my old position at Unify and I'm hoping to do it again in a company that isn't going to treat me and the customers like resources that should be exploited until they are squeezed to death. I think the one thing that I look forward to this that I would be helping people with their problems which something that I truly enjoy. One thing that I want to look at is learning more of the back end when it comes to these kinds of systems. The last time, I relied on development to work out the details on connecting the front end to the different databases, which was the wrong decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Working out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I've been thinking about for the last couple of days is how I'd start working out. Currently, most of my time is spent working or driving my daughters to various activities. But life is better when I work out, I wonder if I should just wake up earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="jobs"></category><category term="exercise"></category></entry><entry><title>Ice and jobs</title><link href="/2012/02/ice-and-jobs.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-20T22:33:13-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-02-20:2012/02/ice-and-jobs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm thinking about doing my push up challenge again. The push up challenge has been something that I've done many times over the last three years to start off a work out routine and I've always liked the quick results it gives me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the girls to see the Disney on Ice show today and it was equally enjoyable to see the show and to have the girls watch it. They both were on the edge of their seats as they watched the Toy Story 3 characters run around and try to save the day. I wonder when my children will understand some of the bigger plot lines from the movie, because it's kind of deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the prices for things at those things are crazy. I understand that as parents, we all want to give our children the best but don't think the best things in life are $12 stale pop corn and 15 dollar iceess that come in mugs with buzz lightyears face. What kind of leasson are we teaching out children when we spend 20 dollars on something that has a value sooo much less than that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On the job front&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still no calls, and it looks like I'm going to have a harsh road ahead. I feel that this is partially my fault for trusting that I'd have something at the end of all this. I worked hard, but in the end it leads to nothing because I'm worried about what will happen next week. I know a lot of people worry like I do, but it doesn't make it better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not in the slightest...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="kids"></category><category term="jobs"></category><category term="worry"></category></entry><entry><title>The writing bug</title><link href="/2012/02/the-writing-bug.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-19T12:12:34-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-02-19:2012/02/the-writing-bug.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I challenged myself to write 250 words every day and although some days were harder than others, I found myself enjoying it and going over the required minimum. I really enjoyed making the transition for having a ton of words running around my head to having them placed into something that I can review and format&lt;sup id="fnref:formatting_stress"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:formatting_stress" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For most of my life, I've been a little bit of a perfectionist and sometimes the words that I want to say don't quite measure up to the standards I'd like. This whole thing, although only weeks old has been rewarding as a way to become better at writing and allowing me to get past my own hang ups on writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I got sick about a week ago and had to take a little bit of break in order to focus on not throwing up followed shortly by a scramble to look for another job because my contract at Intel is going to expire soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the writing bug has bit me and I don't want to deny it any longer. I enjoy journaling because it allows me to get my thoughts together and think about what my plans are going to be moving forward. I hope that who ever reads this in the future and learn something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That isn't to say I didn't stress out about the best way to store all these snippets that I've built up, but it was nice to put most of that aside and just work on my thoughts and getting things out of my head.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:formatting_stress" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I went to the lindy hop lesson again and I think I did pretty good on most of the drills except for the lindy circle and I rediscovered that I have a small issue where I pull a follow out of their anchor step. It's weird to be reminded that there is a little "and" before you start dancing. I met a couple good people during the dance and it was great meeting people who dance for the sheer enjoyment of it versus trying to meet people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I've matured quite a bit because I didn't get stuck in my own head and compare myself against every other dancer including what I imagined what I was able to do during my "glory days". I just took it as a chance to have fun and work on my basic&lt;sup id="fnref:basic_dance"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:basic_dance" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The eyes have it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughter has a bug bite on her eye and it's swollen up pretty bad. Today, after I picked her up, she told me about how all the kids were asking about it. I don't know exactly how she felt, so I tried to let her know that she'll be alright and that the other kids just wanted to make sure that she was alright. Luckily, the eye is getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:basic_dance"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly feel that a follow would rather have a great experience doing basic moves then a lousy one with lots of moves that drive her crazy. That isn't to say a follower won't enjoy a good turn or two.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:basic_dance" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She had woken up with a very pink and very swollen right eye. We didn't know if it was pink eye or something else so we had her stay home and then we took her to the doctor later in the morning. It was pretty nice spending time with her during the day because although the eye looked pretty bad, it didn't really hurt her too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She seemed to really enjoy the day that we had together and I even thought about taking her to work tomorrow if her eye doesn't get better. I think it would be nice for her to see where daddy works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing Hooky&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that I'm not in the office, work still comes in. Normally, this isn't a problem because I would connect to all of my necessary machines remotely ad do the work without having to deal with lag. Things have changed because I've since given away those machines to the guy I'm training to replace me. File transfers are horrible and the performance of the machine is terribly slow when I'm attempting to make a video, run a test or just check my email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Star Wars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last week or so, I've been trying to get the girls to sit down and watch Star Wars with me. Apparently, they do not have the patience to learn about a galaxy far, far away... They ask to watch it, but 30 minutes into it they fall asleep or go off and play. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="kids"></category><category term="movies"></category></entry><entry><title>vomit</title><link href="/2012/02/vomit.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-07T14:23:12-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-02-07:2012/02/vomit.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning, I woke up to vomit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a very long night filled with little ones who don't like sleeping in their own beds by themselves coming to invade mommy and daddy's bed, I was awakened to a desperate plea for water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran to get the water, she took two sips and then promptly threw up...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... in the bed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... on the way to bathroom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... not in the bathroom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... but on the way out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, my wife was able to take care of her during the day. So that I could go to work and train my replacement some more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oh, the horrors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last year, I've been busy at work attempting to get an automated tool to work as it was designed. In fact, at one point I was attempting to automate the automated tool so that everyone could benefit by not running it. Personally, I thought this was a pointless endevour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the point of automating an automated tool? Especially when that first tool is being modified and changed on an almost daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I managed to get the system somewhat working but I found myself having to do a significant amount of working trying to fix other issues and it kind of died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the problems still persist. I welcome automation, but I have to question the logic when were are stacking issues upon issues like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improvements in writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been doing this 250 word thing for almost 3 weeks now and I haven't done any editing on entries that I make. The original goal of this project was to get my thoughts out of my head and have something to look at as an achievement. I'm currently debating on whether I should read them because the process might make me too self conscience to write more.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="kids"></category><category term="writing"></category><category term="work"></category></entry><entry><title>funderland</title><link href="/2012/02/funderland.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-05T10:34:23-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-02-05:2012/02/funderland.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today was a great day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truly great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family went to funderland and had a wonderful time going on the little rides. It's at these times that I really realize that time isn't going to stand still. Already, some of the rides are too small for my oldest and I worry that the simple things in life won't be enough to entertain them. That doesn't mean they'll want to go bungie jumping next year, but it could certainly make things different if they would rather sit at home and play video games then spend some time at the park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, my oldest has been wanting to play the game &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cootie_(game)" title="Not the one where you pretend a the opposite sex is yucky, but I'll take that too!"&gt;Cooties&lt;/a&gt; and it's been fun interacting with her. I think I've mentioned that I have trouble sometimes interacting with her and I want to spend as many chances as I can to let my children know who I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dance Shape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have made up after a couple days of quite rioting and we've both decided that I needed more ways of reducing stress. So, I'll be going dancing on a more regular basis &lt;sup id="fnref:trial_basis"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:trial_basis" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The thing about this is that I'm starting over. When I'm on the floor it feels like I've never danced before. All I can remember is how to keep my hands in the right spot (so I don't get slapped) and how to keep rhythm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every dance, I'm winded and I feel muscles that haven't been used in years burn with awakening. It hurts me physically, but my pride is swelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:trial_basis"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning the next couple fridays or ...&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:trial_basis" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What's the deal people? I think that if you decide to have a pet you must understand that you have a responsibility to not only feed and clean it but to clean up after it. Another thing that sucks is that I just got a dog so when I walk by my neighbors I get te stink eye because I'm going to be grouped up with the other dog owners who leave the little surprises everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I need to come up with a way to relax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hoping that this journaling thing would help me relax, but since I made a commitment of writing 250 everyday, it can be difficult on some days to come up with something to write and the stress of trying to think of something in the last moment has been somewhat stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the last couple of weeks of employment come up, I've been increasingly stressed out about it and I think I'm transfering some of those negative emotions into my marriage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is it not fair and will only cause more problems, but it does nothing to reduce the initial problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dance, Baby, Dance!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it looks like, I've been given the OK to go dancing again next week by the wife. She's kind of the jeolous type, but -aparently- I've been so stressed that she'd rather have me go out and blow off some steam then have me brooding at home.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="dance"></category><category term="stress"></category></entry><entry><title>I went dancing</title><link href="/2012/02/i-went-dancing.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-03T11:59:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-02-03:2012/02/i-went-dancing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The wife had basically kicked me out and said that I needed some time alone and she wanted some time with the girls. Up until this point, we had been in a silent one sided argument over whether or not a certain someone should wear chapstick on their lips because it causes the other party to have a split lip. So I called up my friend, Nick, and made plans for tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I was amprehensive. I haven't danced in years and I have a tendency to be very hard on myself and this sometimes gets compounded when I remember/imagine how good I used to be and look at where my skill level is now. But I got over myself and said that I was going to go enjoy myself and not critize myself too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to the dance lesson before hand and felt like I was starting off from scratch. This actually made me feel better because I could just concentrate on getting better and not think about how good it could have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Like Father, Like Daughter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I noticed about me going out dancing is that I act like my daughter when the instructor is talking. I play around, make jokes and generally lose track of the specific counts for new moves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I feel bad and correct myself too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I goof off again. I think it's alright because the people around me enjoy it. Sure, I don't learn that specific move very well at the time. But I feel the relaxed atmosphere makes  it easier to find the rhythem of the dance and make the total dance better than one or two moves.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="dancing"></category></entry><entry><title>Evening Ramble</title><link href="/2012/02/evening-ramble.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-01T10:34:23-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-02-01:2012/02/evening-ramble.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Respect is very valuable to a relationship. When we decide to trust someone with our hearts there is a rule, either spoken or commonly understood, that the two people in the relationship will respect each other as human beings. Sometimes we forget, sometimes we take each other for granted, but if you continue to disrespect your partner, you're going to have some real problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;On the Hunt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I'm wondering how all of this is going to pan out. Time is running out...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've thought about what kind of goals I'd like to reach in the next couple of days and I think they are pretty &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T"&gt;S.M.A.R.T&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Training Others&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still training my replacement at my current job and it has definitely been a unique experience for me. To me, I see this as more evidence of our disposable culture. My employer sees me as a tool that can easily be replaced. This flies in the face of my goal of being someone that doesn't need a rèsumè in order to get hired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the company is concerned, this is standard business practice. A way to cut cost by not paying benefits and then being able to let people go without any remorse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen, if you don't like it. You don't have to work here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Project Development&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm kicking around a couple ideas at the moment and they will continue to be ideas for the foreseeable future due to some time contraints I'm under. I don't want to put anything here because that would be another commitment that I've got to think about. &lt;/p&gt;

The problem all started when she had a car accident one night&lt;sup id="fnref:car crash"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:car crash" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the car was totaled. Others would have cut their loses then and there, but I think that because this was the first car that she bought with her own money she saw it as something worth saving&lt;sup id="fnref:saving"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:saving" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and has literally spent enough money in repairs that she probably could have bought a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really feel sorry for her. The world does not have an easy way of telling us wether or not something is good deal and when it comes to mechanics, even if they are honest, it doesn't mean that they know what they are doing. I've run into my fair share of people who simply want to make the most money they can from you. I've heard people say that the price for anything is "what the customer can afford". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are we doing to each other? It seemed like "Honest work for honest pay" is a forgotten concept in our ever consumer focused world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it also got me thinking about how our disposable culture. How is it even though everyone seemed to like me at work that I'm still facing a hard end date for leaving and finding something else. I was part of the team, a reliable rock that could get things moving...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a couple weeks, I'll be gone and that person I trained will be doing what I did for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don't blame the guy and &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; people have said that I should withhold some of the knowledged that I've accumulated along the way, but I won't do that because I don't need the bad karma and I'm not in the business of burning bridges. The guy is actually pretty nice and was quiet and just soaked up what I was telling him.&lt;/p&gt;

I managed to spend sometime with my family, get some rest and look for a new job without feeling that I was cheat so other important goal. Still, I don't think that new job is going to fall into my lap, but I'm optimistic that if worse comes to worse, I can find something to keep the lights on and make sure that my family isn't hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in myself and I believe in the power of family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I write it down it does sound like and affirmation, but I don't see that as a problem. What is wrong with having a positive attitude? It seems that a lot of people don't feel the need to grasps the importance of simply enjoying the moment. Like they  are saving all the happy moments for some grand retirement in the bahamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I can tell you this now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is guaranteed and -honestly- nothing is "deserved".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the retirement. Not happiness. Not even that career for working your ass off in college. People change, plans change. If you haven't heard this yet, I'm sorry to busrt your bubble and be &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I was always told I was smart. I was told that I'd go far in life. I played by the rules given to me and ultimately my career has not come to fruition (just yet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only things in this world that I have at this point in life is the love of my family and friends. It is partially for them that I'm able to get up in the morning and I'm grateful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, it isn't guarunteed that the will be in the greatest of moods, but there is love there.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="family"></category></entry><entry><title>Sick Saturday</title><link href="/2012/01/sick-saturday.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-01-28T22:23:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-01-28:2012/01/sick-saturday.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Everyone woke up late today. This is the second time in less than a week that my wife woke up before I did. Maybe I'm losing my touch, maybe I'm just that tired, my fear is that I just don't care as much. For a little more than a year, I've been getting up early to get everyone up so that we can start the day. I dress my children and get lunches ready and this is no easy task when you take into consideration that I'm trying to round up sleepy 2 and 4 year olds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really makes me respect single mothers who have to do this all by themselves everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, my youngest has become more and more fussy and I'm having trouble dealing with it. I get the impression that she doesn't hear the word no from other people because that's usually what will set her off on a tantrum. Part of me thinks this has more to do with the fact that she doesn't have a lot of her own activities. As a family, we don't have a lot of time together so a significant portion of it is used to take the oldest one to her events because they don't have a lot of things for a 2 year old to do. I've been thinking about what things I can do so that she gets her own time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have been watching Don Juan DiMarco for the last couple of weeks and it has really made me think about what it means to be romantic. I feel it streams from passion. It is the passion we have for each other and the passion that we have for life itself that makes romance possible.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>If you're feeling froggy…</title><link href="/2012/01/if-youre-feeling-froggy.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-01-24T16:04:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-01-24:2012/01/if-youre-feeling-froggy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the past, I've thought about becoming my own boss and running a small business where I make up the rules and direct my energy and focus on something that I enjoy. True, starting out, I would probably have to submit myself to the whims of whatever customers I'd potentially have, but I have a desire to have more control over my career. Not saying that people who work for others don't have that kind of control, so much as to say that I've met more than a few people who want have expressed thoughts of "why did they do this or that" at all the companies I've been at&lt;sup id="fnref:company"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:company" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I've come across a job posting for a programming position at Intel and wanted to apply for it. If I get selected for an interview and get past that there is a programming test with a catch&lt;sup id="fnref:catch"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:catch" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... &lt;em&gt;IF I FAIL&lt;/em&gt;, not only will I not get hired. I won't be able to interview with Intel again for an undefined time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I understand why Intel has done this there are a lot of people out there looking for jobs who look good on paper and may do well in an interview. How do you reduce the amount of people you have to look at if there is a chance that someone who bubbled up from the heap comes back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is making me pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my final thought is, I could apply and not get the job or I could sit here and do nothing garuntee I won't get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm leaning more towards a Dropbox based solution because that has a versioning system and that will help me... Some how?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a great conversation with my wife about a lot of things. What I liked best about it was we weren't talking about something important but that we listen to each other. Two individuals who wanted to share their thoughts and opinions, it's something we definitely need more of because I don't want to wake up one day next to a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="writing"></category><category term="marriage"></category></entry><entry><title>Daughters and Daydreams</title><link href="/2012/01/daughters-and-daydreams.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-01-23T22:47:29-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-01-23:2012/01/daughters-and-daydreams.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today we took my oldest to her karate class and it was entertaining. When she first started she would spin around and dance when the instructor was giving the lessons. I was tempted to pull her out of class until I felt she was old enough, but my wife insisted that if we just give her time and reminded me that we honestly couldn't beat the price for entertainment. I couldn't argue against it because the alternative would be to trying to find something else to do during that time and I didn't like my wife's idea of cruising through the mall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we kept going to class and I found myself getting more and more frustrated as she danced and pranced around while all the other kids tried hard to making it through the lessons. I became one of those over baring parents that you see in the movies (constantly telling my kid not to do this or that). Then one day, something happened... she asked me not to watch her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughter...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...didn't want me to be part of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I was upset. I mean, &lt;em&gt;I was trying to help her get it right!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a while to dawn on me. Was I really helping her by constantly correcting her? She's four years old, she shouldn't have to worry about being perfect. As a parent, I only get one chance to experience these things. I was forcing my own perfectionist views on my daughter and if I wasn't carefull I'd plant a seed doubt in her that would nag her for the rest of her days just like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, one day. I set her down (as best as I can) and told her that I love her and would always be proud of her. I stopped trying to "couch" her and now she asks that I come to her classes. She smiles when I tell her that I saw what she was doing in class. And most important to me, she's proud of herself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="parenting"></category></entry><entry><title>It's almost 2 o'clock</title><link href="/2012/01/its-almost-2-oclock.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-01-23T02:33:44-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-01-23:2012/01/its-almost-2-oclock.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's almost 2 O'clock in the morning and I'm having another one of those nights where I can't sleep and the only thing on my mind is all the things I need to do and all the things that I've done wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;How&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;going&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's hard for me sometimes to see some of the good things that I've done and how I'm making some progress going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that's part of the reason that I started doing this, so that I can get my thoughts out of my head and actually do something else. So what is on my mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, I was thinking about all the people who I feel have taken advantage of me. Part of me forgives them because it is ultimately me who gives them the power over me, but other parts of me is bitter that they would go on with their life and never look back and help me with my situation. A card, a friendly email, something to acknowledge that I helped them get to where they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the world isn't like that and me waiting for that to happen is only going to turn me into a bitter old man instead of the slightly bitter person I'm turning into now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got to stop being so jaded in my life, my daughters are looking up to me as an example of what a person is supposed to be and as an inspiration of what a man can do.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="reflection"></category></entry><entry><title>Sarah Milkins: The Scientist Princess Horse</title><link href="/2012/01/sarah-milkins-the-scientist-princess-horse.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-01-08T22:51:23-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-01-08:2012/01/sarah-milkins-the-scientist-princess-horse.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think one of the benefits of doing this project and making myself write on the computer is that I don't have as much anxiety about writing on a computer. The thoughts and words are appearing to me as fast as they would when I write on paper. In addition, thanks to applications like &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12"&gt;Byword&lt;/a&gt; that allow me to ignore all the spelling mistakes until I'm ready to correct them (if I choose to). My current work flow is to open up a new document and then just start writing until I meet the word requirements and finish my last thought. From there, I give the document a title, created date and tags then save it in a folder structure called "Chronicles" which then separates the entries by year and month. I'll probably set up some kind of folder action to just sort the files after saving, but -for now- I'm focused on the actual writing versus the tools and tech surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I spent some one on one time with my oldest daughter to just play around and have fun. I had asked her if she'd rather make cookies with me which is something that we've been doing more and more of but she seemed to really like the idea of just the two of us using our imagination&lt;sup id="fnref:imagination"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:imagination" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I did my best to keep up with all the ideas that she made up but I think my favorite one was the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Milkins
She's a Princess Scientist horse who succeed when everyone said it was impossible&lt;sup id="fnref:impossible"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:impossible" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
She's 4-5 years old.&lt;br /&gt;
Goes to school a lot, even when she gets fussy...&lt;br /&gt;
Doesn't get fat when she gets older&lt;sup id="fnref:fat_and_old"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fat_and_old" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
There are only a few of them... But there is a lot of others and tons of information about them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just so exciting to see her talk about this idea and we both went to the rest of the family to share. It was one of those great moments when a parent can just sit back and enjoy the their little one's creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we sat in front of the computer and giggled making little movies in PhotoBooth... This was a wonderful evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:imagination"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to be Cinderella and she got to be a talking horse. I hope it doesn't mean much, but the horse was looking for her family because they were too busy taking care of a new baby. If anything, it could be a sub-conscience idea bubbling to the surface because her sister has been sick for the last couple of days causing my wife and I to miss work and tend to the growing piles of vomit.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:imagination" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:impossible"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said that you couldn't be a princess and a scientist. I told her no and I'll put more effort into making sure she has enough exposure to science.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:impossible" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:fat_and_old"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know where she gets this exactly, but I have my suspicions&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:fat_and_old" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, it was the coolest thing having something like myspace to allow me to keep in touch with my friends by sharing pictures, comments and images. It allowed everyone to have a presence on the internet without having to think about setting up (or paying for) ways to connect. As an added bonus, you could personalize the your profile page to reflect your style and interests&lt;sup id="fnref:style"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:style" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I should have known that it wasn't going to last. The sight as a whole became filled with people who seemed to love showing off their animated gif collection and increasing the magic number next to "friends". One time, I got an invitation from my then roommate's sister who I had never met in life simply because she wanted to make it to 400 before her one of her friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook was a breath of fresh air at some point, and it clean, simple and uncustomizable (at the time) interface really drew me in. This was before everyone had a problem with privacy and honestly, I had taken enough cs classes and seen enough movies and tv shows to know that I really shouldn't put anything on there that I wouldn't want Moe Lester to look at. Once again, I was happy to connect with all my friends and see how life was treating them, but it wasn't long before I experienced the same issues of attracting friends who weren't really friends and having a hug stream of information and distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this point, that I started to realize that despite all the time and effort spent maintaining a connection with all my online friends, I felt that I was still missing out on that human connection with those I cared about. The desire to have a long discussion was replace by the desire to have people respond. In order to promote a response or get feed back quicker, I found myself editing myself for lenght or watering down the content to make it less controversal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I continued and started following my friends on twitter. Not only could I get their quips and links, but I was also able to discover other people I found interesting. I had basically let my facebook account just rot away and really enjoyed how twitter brought the information to me instead of me having to chase it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then google+ came out and all of the real life friends I was talking to started using that. The only updates that I see from people I've met in real life are from people doing checkin from 4square&lt;sup id="fnref:4square"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4square" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and I seriously doubt the people I follow can pick me out from their hordes of followers (not that I blame them, I don't have a lot of characteristics that stick out on the web).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, the behemeth that keeps getting bigger and bigger. I'm not arguing that the best of breed should go to the top, but I will say that I'm tired of generating content for other people just so that it can disappear without a trace. I'm tired of spending time working on a connection that really isn't there. I'm more than a node that connects two (or more) points. I find that my voice is just justification that the larger systems (myspace, facebook, google+) should be used in order to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How social are we when we trade our individual voice to be part of the chorus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be "social" then go ahead, but if you want to find me. I'll be here.&lt;/p&gt;

Part of me wants to pick them up and pretend I was able to so that I can surprise her later tonight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't because it's not right. I wouldn't want her to do something like that to me and we should always treat people the way we wanted to be treated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding the time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes find myself wondering "Where did the time go?" or "When am I going to be able to do that?". But what it call comes down to is "What is important to me". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I take the time to set a goal of 250 or 15 minutes a day or do I sit back and relax with a video game? &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Interests</title><link href="/2011/10/interests.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-10-07T21:50:27-07:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2011-10-07:2011/10/interests.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I thought about Steve Jobs and how he impacted my life, I thought about how his passion for things drove him to be the person he is. Then I thought about my passions and took some time to write down some of my interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tech Interests&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Programming on the mac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Objective-C&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me this is more than a little sentimental. I also like the syntax as I like the idea that it takes from smalltalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They" say that you should know at least on scripting language. For some reason, python calls to me more than Ruby. I think it's the contriran in me that wants that doesn't want to do what everyone else is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also Python has bindins in lldb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;lldb&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy the theory of programming languages. My favarite classes were "programing languages" where you learned the evolution of different languages and how they differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second was compiler theory where we built a very basic clone of the c language&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Accebility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not claimig to be a designer, but I remember the time when you had to surf the internet using a dial up modem and how it seemed to take a long time to get information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these pains of that time were sights that used real play or images for everything. There were people offering classes on how to optimize websites, because it was impossible to do anything until it loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got me thinking about what would happen if the pictures never loaded? How can they use it? What if I had trouble using the mouse? I have a number of friends who have asked this same question and I'm reminded of this issue everytime I try to use the computer with my kids in my lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Semantics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the idea of specificing what things are really supposed to mean. If you look at my website now, you should be going to a clean design that easy for people to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Mac Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of great software on all platforms, but it seems like all my favorites are on the mac due to how well they seem to work standalone or together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Automator &amp;amp; Applescript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I play with the idea of using these two tools more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Personal Interests&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to put my ideas into words. I sometimes imagine differn storis (such as action films and children's books) and scenerios (mostly how I would do something different or an argument with someone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my issues is sitting down to write. I critique my writing before I even begin and then I let myself get lost in the tools of writig more than the writing itself. Currently, I'm fighting over what's the best place to keep my notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-improvement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I being the best me that I can be?&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Put Who in the What Now?</title><link href="/2011/09/put-who-in-the-what-now.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-09-05T16:10:01-07:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2011-09-05:2011/09/put-who-in-the-what-now.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I'm taking an Operating Systems class at Sac State and the first feeling is fear. It's been a long time since I've sat down to learn something completely different from what I've done before and I've lost track of that feeling of excitement and discovery when it comes to coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, I do a little bit of coding for work and have kept busy by doing little example programs here and there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, I've been attempting to get myself ready for the class by doing simple exercises with gdb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I can't shake my self doubts. I feel like I'm being followed by a huge shadow that constantly sings a chorus of "You're not good enough", "You're gonna fail", "If you were smarter, you wouldn't have to do this in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;

There's twitter, Facebook, google+, and even myspace; for those of you who are still looking for interesting ways to use the blink tag. The blink tag itself was part of the excitement of the internet at that time and every beginning textbook or html class had an example of how to "best" use it (Hint: Never). Another annoying aspect of being on the internet at that time were the Signatures placed in your outgoing emails. I can understand that a company wants to advertise that they provide free email, but shouldn't the fact that I sent the email via hotmail.com or yahoo.com be enough? To top it off, a lot of free email providers, at the time, where smashed by an assortment of issues like demand for more space and functionality (POP, IMAP, Address Book, etc) and the dreaded SPAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I was more than excited to get a google mail address (Does anyone else call it that?) and only logged into my old account to look at all the spam to remind me of how good I have it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Yahoo! has slowly turned the situation around. The first thing they did was offer free IMAP and contact synchronization to iPhone users. This was great if you had an iPhone, but if you were a regular user you still had to use the web interface if you wanted to send an e-mail, unless you paid for Yahoo! Mail Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then wonders upon wonders, Yahoo opened up &lt;a href="http://www.ymailblog.com/blog/2011/07/yahoo-offers-mail-contacts-instant-messaging-and-calendar-sync-for-apples-new-osx-lion-operating-system-allows-for-unique-contacts-sync-with-macbooks/"&gt;IMAP free for everyone&lt;/a&gt; and eliminated the mountains of spam that onceI get.

&lt;p&gt;Part of me wants to make this blog "Perfect", so I spend too much time thinking about all the little tools I should use to make it. I wonder "How am I going to host images?", "Am I going to continue hosting it on google?", "How do I keep track of old post: Should I leave them on the server or on my local machine?", "What if my laptop gets stolen?", "Should I only write on my laptop or anything I get my hands on?"&lt;/p&gt;

I thought it was pretty good and I'd like to post it to you the internet!
(Note: I didn't take the time to do a second draft this is all from the top of my head).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello Andy, I'm a fan and a happy mac user. I've heard a lot of arguments that I've paid too much for my mac, but I can't think of a time when I had to worry about this or that not working. Anyway, you've probably heard and experienced this story yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of me emailing is that I'm having a hard time arguing with my co-workers in regards to the iPhone. I got one and I love it, the thing is testimate to modern computing and we wouldn't even be having a discussion about "smart" or "feature" phones if it hadn't come to pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me, that a lot of the talk after google IO were complaints against Apple not being open and that the web wanted to be free, but it seems that no one brings up the fact that the very first applications that third party developers could put on the iPhone were &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt; web apps that: 1) Free to develop 2) Free of censorship from apple 3) Freely available to everyone and can run on (basically) any webkit based browser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand some of the frustration that some of the developers are experiencing when it comes for submitting there application, but it seems kind of silly when somebody complains that she or he can't use tool Z on product i so they want to have nothing to do with it (or cancel a national conference).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, I'm reminded of someone saying they want to run their playstation games on a nintendo, but then I look at the people who are actively complaining and I wonder how many of them are console gamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing, I'm tempted to buy the playboy application and do a little blog post about it, because I keep Leo talking about how apple is being hypocritical on their porn policy. I don't think this is true, because the applications that were taken off the store all contain nudity. The description on the playboy application says that it doesn't explicitly. The only thing is that I'm afraid my wife might beat me if she sees it when she syncs here ipod touch, but I think I could get away with it if a respected journalist said I should in order to get the inside scoop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I'd like to thank you for doing what you do. You explain your arguments a lot better than I do and it comes across and solid reasoning. I hope that you've read this and smiled!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salutations!&lt;/p&gt;

To me, being an adult means owning up to your responsibilities and making reasonably rational decisions. I say reasonably because there are things that can't/shouldn't be rationalized. For example, love between exact opposites or why they stopped showing Captain Eo at DisneyLand (completely irrational).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the opposite side of the equation, we have emotion. The western world has a love/hate relationship with emotions. In America, it is written that we should all be working on that constant pursuit for happiness. Some of the best movies are about people who do this.&lt;/p&gt;

It got me thinking about my own relationships. Have I done everything I could do? If I were to die would the people who matter to me go forward with their lives knowing that I wished them well? Would my children know that all I truly want for them is to live a full and happy life? Did I really live life to the fullest and lead by example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last one, I’m going to say ‘no and yes’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t live every moment to the fullest, in fact, I have caught myself drifting in and out a couple times. Like the song from Linkin Park, ‘It’s easier to run’, I find that I’ve got a certain part of myself that just zones out sometimes. That says ‘Hey, I don’t think I can change this situation so why fight it?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, it’s horrible, but I think it’s how most people are ‘living’ there life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think that’s why people cheat on their spouses and just treat people like shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I’m tired of it. Really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m tired of being told to live in a little box, and I’m tired of being told to shhhh and keep quiet about things for the stupidest of reasons. That, in the end, come back to ultimately bite me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I feel that a lot of people are just set in their ways. I could tell a certain someone that I love them a hundred times and they would only look back to a time I didn’t return their phone call because I was changing a diaper and say that I’m a liar. I could tell someone that they should stand up make a change to some kind of product and that person could say ‘Hey, my hands are tied because the boss gave me these things to do.’ I could hug someone and they would only say that I’m only doing it because it’s expected and not because I want to become closer to them and I may never be able to do it again. I could take someone’s keys to make sure they don’t drink and drive, but that person would only see me as attempting to belittle them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a certain point, I’ve got to say ‘Listen, I’m an adult and you’re an adult. I’m going to go this way. You can do whatever you want.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to stop there because I have to be at work in 5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>We are outta here!</title><link href="/2010/02/we-are-outta-here.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-02-28T20:30:31-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2010-02-28:2010/02/we-are-outta-here.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've moved!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="milestone"></category></entry><entry><title>Review (February 18th, 2010)</title><link href="/2010/02/review-february-18th-2010.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-02-18T21:44:51-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2010-02-18:2010/02/review-february-18th-2010.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been pushed off of my review wagon (again).

It's a kind of pride and warm feeling to see them grow from little meatballs into little girls. I'm not looking forward to have them leave one day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My job.
It's been able to support our house hold at a standard of living that's becoming harder and harder to maintain in this economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The economic rock on which we stand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of economy, I've been thinking about how even though we are in a recession, there seems to be more and more ads on things. Once again, I'm not a communist, but it seems crazy that our society has no problems having all these messages about buying things when most Americans are having problems balancing thier budgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caeer builder recently had a survey stating that 42 percent of their &lt;a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?id=pr651&amp;amp;sd=8/11/2011&amp;amp;ed=8/11/2099"&gt;respondents&lt;/a&gt; were living paycheck to paycheck. I think it is more of a personal thing rather than the amount of money that people make. From a very young age we are taught to keep up with "the Jones'" and the other thing that we are taught about money is the single semester of econ&lt;sup id="fnref:econ_class"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:econ_class" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in high school. Personally, I think that it's a little late because by then all your classmates have already been bombarded by barbie, GI Joe and Disney and I doubt many of them have an idea of what it is costing to live like they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My econ teacher was pretty well off. Her husband made a lot of money and this was her way of giving back to society. There were many rumors about her drinking in her car between classes.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:econ_class" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I vaguely remember someone once saying that its how we deal with events that define us. I had some very interesting things happen to me since the last time I did a review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I got sick again. This time it was really bad and I couldn’t leave the bathroom for more than an hour or two before my stomach emptied itself. I don’t think I’ve been sick like that in years and I’m seriously considering talking to my doctor about why I’ve been getting sick so often. My wife says that it might be all the stress of working, a general level of dissatisfaction with where I am in my life, the relationship between me and my family, the list is long. But I definitely could be worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, pack up the kids, we are moving! We are moving to a two story townhouse that has almost twice the amount of space of our current place. We’re put the deposit down and we’re just waiting for the credit checks and then we’ll be set for the end of the month to move in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I looked at the number of posts that I did in January(12) and compared it with the number of posts that I did back in 2009 (36) and 2008 (24). Wow, that’s a lot of information to put on “Da Google.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forth, I came across a journal that I used to keep up a couple years ago and -honestly- I could write a post about it alone. It was sad that I looked at it and saw that I am still dealing with issues from back then. To sum it up, it’s been more reason to do more in order to move my life forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal Accomplishments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wake up &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up a work journal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things on my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make it all better...&lt;/li&gt;

Maybe it’s all the stress that I’ve been under: Looking for a new place to live, Asking for a raise, unresolved issues with my family, weird sleeping schedule (the kids), pressure to produce &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here’s a quick review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accomplishments:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asked for a raise (Which was quickly followed by questions of “How do you do that special XYZ thing you do?) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep my head when I found out my account information was used to make some weird purchases &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a post to email-init to further information about email clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things on my mind:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a place to live &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on my personal relationships &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a deeper review than this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically the same thing as last week&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="review"></category></entry><entry><title>Hacked!</title><link href="/2010/01/hacked.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-01-23T11:39:38-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2010-01-23:2010/01/hacked.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I got a notification that someone had stolen my account information to buy things online and that my account is going to be closed for the time being. It just goes to show that you have to be on top of this kind of stuff and people will take your money even if you don’t have a lot in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, I just got the bill for the fixes to my doorway that was kicked in last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;$326!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must be out of your mind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about bad timing!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="money"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Peacoats and Money Diets</title><link href="/2010/01/peacoats-and-money-diets.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-01-17T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2010-01-17:2010/01/peacoats-and-money-diets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My wife and I took the kids to Costco today to load up on some of the necessities (namely toilet paper). As it is now fall, Costco has brought out some of their winter wear and my wife was a beautiful peacoat. My wife loves peacoats and has been saying that she would like something new because she's been loosing weight due to her new found passion for running. Like any husband I would love to get her the dress, but we have already bought her two other jackets in the last year plus a Scottevest that we got on sale two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't afford it. We haven't a need nor do we have any money in the budget for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife tries on a few and then sadly places the item back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when my oldest daughter asks why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't even think about it and say, "We don't have the money to buy it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instantly, my wife get's angry. Later on we talk about it briefly in the car and she tells me that I should have told our daughter about it in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Should I have said, 'We can't afford it'?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No, you should say it in a way so she won't misunderstand and get picked on."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I let the subject drop because I'm frustrated. As far as I'm concerned, I told my daughter exactly why we couldn't buy the coat in a way that shouldn't make anyone feel offended. I think it's one of the most important financial lessons an adult (or any one else for that matter) should know. You don't buy things if you can't afford them. If I had learned this lesson earlier or taken it to heart years ago, I'd be in a different financial situation. I don't want my daughters to go down that path an I certainly don't want them to think that they are less because they can't get everything they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's ok to know our limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But didn't I just say that I'm guilty of this as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, b-b-but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've decided to place myself on a spending diet. I've already paid most of my bills for this month. I'm going to set aside $200 for gas and other expenses and place that in a my new Golden1 checking account and see how things go from there. I'm hoping that it helps me realize that the money my family needs to survive is different then the money I use for wantsies. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="money"></category><category term="parenting"></category></entry><entry><title>Review (January 15, 2010)</title><link href="/2010/01/review-january-15-2010.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-01-15T20:46:34-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2010-01-15:2010/01/review-january-15-2010.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'd like to take this time to thank myself for not going completely crazy this last week.

&lt;p&gt;But, I'd like to take some time and do a little weekly review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal accomplishments this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish two projects for work that will reward the company for a while &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep my cool despite the constant pressure to find a new place and money to pay for it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut back on my liquid sugar intake. No soda! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did a weekly review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things Still on my Mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make more income &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to improve the relationship I have with my family &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some more activities that I can do with my children in the winter time&lt;/li&gt;

That there was some list out there that kept track of my every mistake and that it prevented me from getting a raise at my current job or to move to another job. There was a guy who let me look at the list and it was filled with minute and cryptic offenses. The whole time I stood there shocked because there wasn't a way to defend myself... it was all on the paper that I wasn't supposed to see in the first place. What do I do? How can this be fair? Some of the things were so small as to seems inconsequential. Some of them had nothing to do with who I was, what I had done in the past or how I had changed over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
