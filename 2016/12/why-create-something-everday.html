</header><p>So this post is more of a follow up to explain my logic for what I'm doing. Sometimes, it's just good to write out your thoughts.</p>
<p>{% maincolumn "../../images/Create_something_everyday.png" "I find myself putting more and more of my thoughts into mindmaps. I will have to come up with a way to put them into better drafts." %}</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>What would making something every day do for me?  That was the question that I asked myself. I've been missing something for months if not years and it was the satisfaction that I was creating something meaningful outside of being a parent. I was feeling helpless and I was slowly seeing things not getting done. </p>
<p>I was losing control.</p>
<p>I feel that this will allow me a jump start into taking some control. </p>
<p>As opposed to learning to control my body via exercise and meditation<sup id="fnref-meditation"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-meditation">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>What Counts</h2>
<p>The last two are things that I've never made before and I'd like to make it part of my challenge to get something in front of other people. Honestly, I don't know how many people read my blog anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog Entries</li>
<li>Tutorials</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Examples</li>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Vlog</li>
</ul>
<h2>What doesn’t count</h2>
<p>These are things that I was doing anyway and I don't want to make it part of the challenge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Journal Entries</li>
<li>Tweets</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm also doing those things as well, but I'm not going to focus on those changes.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-meditation" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
