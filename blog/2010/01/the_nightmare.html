<p>Today, I woke up from a nightmare. I dreamed that I was unable to move forward with my life. That there was some list out there that kept track of my every mistake and that it prevented me from getting a raise at my current job or to move to another job. There was a guy who let me look at the list and it was filled with minute and cryptic offenses. The whole time I stood there shocked because there wasn&#8217;t a way to defend myself&#8230; it was all on the paper that I wasn&#8217;t supposed to see in the first place. What do I do? How can this be fair? Some of the things were so small as to seems inconsequential. Some of them had nothing to do with who I was, what I had done in the past or how I had changed over the&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>Waking up, I realized that I was looking at the fear I&#8217;ve of just letting my past mistakes dictate who I am and denying myself of the possibility of being&nbsp;better.</p>
