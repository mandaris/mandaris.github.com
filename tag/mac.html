<p>Last month, I saw a deal for the setup mac software subscription. I had originally signed up for it when the service started but didn’t continue with it because I was trying to save money and a lot of the applications that they were promoting were things that I had already purchased over the years. Since the deal was essentially %40 off, I thought give it a shot.</p>
<p>So far, I’m really enjoying that it allows me to experiment with different software. In fact, I’ve been writing on the mac power users discourse forums about it and I wanted to put those stories on my blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I really like the idea of SetApp, but I just feel like it came around too late. I am sure that there are gems in there that I don’t know about, but I really wish it was around before I bought Ulysses, CleanMyMac, ForkLift, etc on their own.
I really want to subscribe, but feel like it is a waste due to all the apps I already own.
Anyone else?

<p>I kind of feel the same way when I tried it when it first came out. There were a couple of apps that I kind of wanted to try but I couldn’t justify the cost. At the time, I already owned most of the key software that they had because of different bundles and needs that had come before that.</p>
<p>But then the sale came and I was able to jump on for about $70. I figured this would give me a chance to try out Ulysses and others. The funny thing is that my wife was using our mac to scan something and the software was spitting out a huge pdf. Preview has an option to make a pdf smaller but the quality is unusable. I right clicked to open it up in pdfpen, when I saw that PDF Squeezer was there.</p>
<p>A couple clicks and boom, I was a hero.</p>
<p>One of the few times she’s complemented me on spending money on software.

<p>I thought that the one time would be good enough to warrant subscribing for next year, but then another incident happened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, another story of how setapp has really saved my bacon and I’ve only had it for about a month.</p>
<p>I’ve given my wife the bad advice of just pulling her thumb drive out of the computer. Well, it just happens that this time it actually became corrupted.</p>
<p>She was <em>furious</em>.</p>
<p>She said -to paraphrase- “only this stuff happens on the mac!”</p>
<p>I know… some of you are thinking that’s grounds for a divorce.</p>
<p>I started to panic, I started questioning all my life choices.</p>
<p>I did a search using Bing! and found some links on how to fix a corrupted USB drive and most of them were to re-format. I didn’t want to take the chance that I’d lose her data, so I did a search for “drive” in the setapp library and saw “Disk Drill”.</p>
<p>It was able to find the files on the usb drive and I restored it to the desktop for my wife to look over.</p>
<p>Marriage saved once again.

<p>I love working on my laptop!</p>
<p>I got it in 2009 and it has been good to me all of these years. Apple no longer supports it for OS updates but that doesn't mean that I can't get on it and still do everything that I was doing before with it.</p>
<p>In fact, I think I'm enjoying not getting the latest OS updates. </p>
<p>At first, I felt I was missing out because of the new features, but I'm having some trouble thinking about what features I've been missing out of other than siri. </p>
<p>And to be honest, I don't know <a href="http://dictationcommands.com">how great siri is on a mac</a>.</p>
