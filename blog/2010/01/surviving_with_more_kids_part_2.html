<p>Well, I don&#8217;t want to say that the honeymoon phase is over, but I will say that things have become a lot more&#8230; hectic.I guess the first day had a lot going for it since I only saw them for 4 hours before it was time for them to go to bed and we were lucky to be able to take them all to the park followed by the library where they can run off a lot of&nbsp;energy.</p>
<p>Yesterday, was different. Thankfully, my mom took the older girls out to the museum and to go eat and when they got back they had cookies and cake. I -in my infinite wisdom- then told my wife that she should go out and take a break from all the kids and although it took a lot of convincing she (although she did take our youngest which I was grateful for&nbsp;later).</p>
<p>After that, things weren&#8217;t as bad as you would think, but it wasn&#8217;t perfect either. I was running around breaking up little fights over toys and turns. The kids screaming &#8220;<span class="caps">NO</span>! It&#8217;s my turn&#8221; and running to the other side of the room because someone is doing something they shouldn&#8217;t: Spilling things, taking things, eating things, thankfully not breaking things, but I&#8217;m sure something has disappeared into that magical land that missing socks go. I even attempted to go over letters with very poor results. I could tell that the oldest one was frustrated, but I hope that I&#8217;ll be able to get her to recognize most of the alphabet before she&nbsp;leaves.</p>
<p>Eventually, the girls settled and I managed to get them all into bed without the same hassle as the night before. Although, I did have one call me a dozen times for various things until I put my foot&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>One thing of note was although our guest don&#8217;t seem to get along during the day, the oldest one does show some concern for her sister. I feel sad for them because with all the drama that they&#8217;ve gone through the only one&#8217;s they truly have is each other. To wrap it up, this time I got to sleep in the bed and had to share it with my&nbsp;oldest.</p>
<p>She threw up on me&nbsp;twice.</p></article></p>        </section>
