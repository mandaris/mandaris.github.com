      I'm tired of chasing

  </h2>
</header><div class="e-content post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I've been having a nagging feeling in the back of my mind for the last couple of months (if not years) about the whole social media thing. </p>
<p>At first, it was the coolest thing having something like myspace to allow me to keep in touch with my friends by sharing pictures, comments and images. It allowed everyone to have a presence on the internet without having to think about setting up (or paying for) ways to connect. As an added bonus, you could personalize the your profile page to reflect your style and interests<sup id="fnref-style"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-style">1</a></sup>. </p>
<p>But I should have known that it wasn't going to last. The sight as a whole became filled with people who seemed to love showing off their animated gif collection and increasing the magic number next to "friends". One time, I got an invitation from my then roommate's sister who I had never met in life simply because she wanted to make it to 400 before her one of her friends. </p>
<p>Facebook was a breath of fresh air at some point, and it clean, simple and uncustomizable (at the time) interface really drew me in. This was before everyone had a problem with privacy and honestly, I had taken enough cs classes and seen enough movies and tv shows to know that I really shouldn't put anything on there that I wouldn't want Moe Lester to look at. Once again, I was happy to connect with all my friends and see how life was treating them, but it wasn't long before I experienced the same issues of attracting friends who weren't really friends and having a hug stream of information and distraction.</p>
<p>It was at this point, that I started to realize that despite all the time and effort spent maintaining a connection with all my online friends, I felt that I was still missing out on that human connection with those I cared about. The desire to have a long discussion was replace by the desire to have people respond. In order to promote a response or get feed back quicker, I found myself editing myself for lenght or watering down the content to make it less controversal.</p>
<p>But, I continued and started following my friends on twitter. Not only could I get their quips and links, but I was also able to discover other people I found interesting. I had basically let my facebook account just rot away and really enjoyed how twitter brought the information to me instead of me having to chase it.</p>
<p>Then google+ came out and all of the real life friends I was talking to started using that. The only updates that I see from people I've met in real life are from people doing checkin from 4square<sup id="fnref-4square"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-4square">2</a></sup> and I seriously doubt the people I follow can pick me out from their hordes of followers (not that I blame them, I don't have a lot of characteristics that stick out on the web).</p>
<p>Google, the behemeth that keeps getting bigger and bigger. I'm not arguing that the best of breed should go to the top, but I will say that I'm tired of generating content for other people just so that it can disappear without a trace. I'm tired of spending time working on a connection that really isn't there. I'm more than a node that connects two (or more) points. I find that my voice is just justification that the larger systems (myspace, facebook, google+) should be used in order to contact me.</p>
<p>How social are we when we trade our individual voice to be part of the chorus.</p>
<p>If you want to be "social" then go ahead, but if you want to find me. I'll be here.</p>

<p>That's what I've been telling myself for a couple years now, and it seems like I'm only giving it lip service. </p>
<p>The problem (other than follow through) is finding something cool to work on. It is sooo much easier to look at what I <em>don't</em> want to work on. </p>
<p>Recently, I went back to school to get some more 'learnin' and it was actually a lot of fun after the initial issues not having been in a class room since 2004. The [professor][chang] was not only knowledgable but actually cared about teaching understanding. For a second, I even thought about going back to school so that I could teach as well.</p>
<p>The most important thing about it was that I really got back into the passion of programming. I enjoyed completing the assignments and working with a group of people towards a common goal. </p>
<p>That is what I want to do.</p>

<p>I recently loaned a friend of mine my copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_of_the_paradise">Phantom of the Paradise</a> with a note stating that it used to be one of my all time favorite movies. This got me questioning myself on if this was removed from being one of my favorite movies what replaced it?</p>
<p>So here is a list of my favorite movies in no particular order.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Big Hit<br>
This was my first taste of comedy/action. It introduced me to a bunch of actors that I'd be happy to see in years to come.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Army of Darkness<br>
Hail to the king, baby!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Batman Begins<br>
Restarted a francise and curse the world with a march of new superhero movies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Death to Smoochy<br>
This movie is great</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aladin<br>
A whole new world! One of Disney's most popular male animated characters.</p>

<h4 id="the-maps">The maps.</h4>
<p>My wife wants me to pick up some maps for her presentation tomorrow. It's really important to her because she's emailed me twice and called at least once to confirm that I'm going to pick them up. Part of me wants to pick them up and pretend I was able to so that I can surprise her later tonight. </p>
<p>I won't because it's not right. I wouldn't want her to do something like that to me and we should always treat people the way we wanted to be treated. </p>
<h4 id="finding-the-time">Finding the time</h4>
<p>I sometimes find myself wondering "Where did the time go?" or "When am I going to be able to do that?". But what it call comes down to is "What is important to me". </p>
<p>Do I take the time to set a goal of 250 or 15 minutes a day or do I sit back and relax with a video game? </p>

<p>When I thought about Steve Jobs and how he impacted my life, I thought about how his passion for things drove him to be the person he is. Then I thought about my passions and took some time to write down some of my interests.</p>
<h3 id="tech-interests">Tech Interests</h3>
<h4 id="programming-on-the-mac">Programming on the mac</h4>
<h5 id="objective-c">Objective-C</h5>
<p>For me this is more than a little sentimental. I also like the syntax as I like the idea that it takes from smalltalk.</p>
<h5 id="python">Python</h5>
<p>"They" say that you should know at least on scripting language. For some reason, python calls to me more than Ruby. I think it's the contriran in me that wants that doesn't want to do what everyone else is doing.</p>
<p>Also Python has bindins in lldb.</p>
<h5 id="lldb">lldb</h5>
<p>I enjoy the theory of programming languages. My favarite classes were "programing languages" where you learned the evolution of different languages and how they differ.</p>
<p>The second was compiler theory where we built a very basic clone of the c language</p>
<h4 id="web-development">Web development</h4>
<h5 id="accebility">Accebility</h5>
<p>I'm not claimig to be a designer, but I remember the time when you had to surf the internet using a dial up modem and how it seemed to take a long time to get information.</p>
<p>One of these pains of that time were sights that used real play or images for everything. There were people offering classes on how to optimize websites, because it was impossible to do anything until it loaded.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about what would happen if the pictures never loaded? How can they use it? What if I had trouble using the mouse? I have a number of friends who have asked this same question and I'm reminded of this issue everytime I try to use the computer with my kids in my lap.</p>
<h5 id="semantics">Semantics</h5>
<p>I love the idea of specificing what things are really supposed to mean. If you look at my website now, you should be going to a clean design that easy for people to read.</p>
<h4 id="other-mac-stuff">Other Mac Stuff</h4>
<p>There are tons of great software on all platforms, but it seems like all my favorites are on the mac due to how well they seem to work standalone or together.</p>
<h5 id="automator-applescript">Automator &amp; Applescript</h5>
<p>I play with the idea of using these two tools more. </p>
<h3 id="personal-interests">Personal Interests</h3>
<h4 id="writing">Writing</h4>
<p>I like to put my ideas into words. I sometimes imagine differn storis (such as action films and children's books) and scenerios (mostly how I would do something different or an argument with someone).</p>
<p>One of my issues is sitting down to write. I critique my writing before I even begin and then I let myself get lost in the tools of writig more than the writing itself. Currently, I'm fighting over what's the best place to keep my notes.</p>
<h4 id="self-improvement">Self-improvement</h4>
<p>Am I being the best me that I can be?</p>

      What does 250 words look like?
    </a>
  </h2>
</header><div class="e-content post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I recently applied to become a professional blogger for macuser.com (a blog run by macworld). As part of the application process, I was to write two articles of 250-300 words to show my qualifications as a writer. I've writen them an have since placed them on my blog.</p>
<p>I remember feeling stressed about creating the entries. Although I like to journal my thoughts time to time. Sitting down and coming up with something for other people to read make me nervous and I had tons of questions like : "What would I write about?", "How can I make what I wrote stand out from the dozens if not hundreds of applicants?" One doubt that really got to e ws the question about how I could do something like this about three times a week and whether or not I truely wanted too.</p>
<p>Now I'm not going to say i'm happy I didn't get the job because I'm not. I would love to get paidfor writing, but I don't think working for macuser at this point in time would be good for the writer in me. I want to be a good write and I feel that writing (like some many other things) needs active practice to get better. The best way to do that is want to write better (other than actually doing it).</p>
<p>At this point, I'm not at the level of <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/author/john-siracusa/">John Siracusa</a> or <a href="http://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc</a>, but they weren't always who they are now.</p>
<p>I can only sit down down and write for my #1 audience and that's me.</p>

<p>So I'm taking an Operating Systems class at Sac State and the first feeling is fear. It's been a long time since I've sat down to learn something completely different from what I've done before and I've lost track of that feeling of excitement and discovery when it comes to coding.</p>
<p>True, I do a little bit of coding for work and have kept busy by doing little example programs here and there. </p>
<p>True, I've been attempting to get myself ready for the class by doing simple exercises with gdb.</p>
<p>But, I can't shake my self doubts. I feel like I'm being followed by a huge shadow that constantly sings a chorus of "You're not good enough", "You're gonna fail", "If you were smarter, you wouldn't have to do this in the first place."</p>
<p>Breathe... </p>
<p>I'm going to make it... Somehow...</p>

<p>After Intuit’s announcement that they would only be supporting <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/146714/2010/02/quicken_essentials.html">Quicken Essentials</a> in Lion, other mac developers were happy to ease the troubled mind of users with <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/161401/2011/08/lion_personal_finance_quicken_alternatives.html">various options</a> that were designed to take advantage of some of the features of the new OS. Since the last <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/142864/2009/09/ifinance3.html">review</a> of iFinance, Synium Software, the maker of <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/152202/2010/06/chronories.html">Chronories</a> and <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/58184/2007/06/macfamilytree44.html">MacFamilyTree</a>, have been working hard to make version 3.3 a release that can standup in comparison with the other options. </p>
<p>The first improved feature that you will notice is the stock tracker graph which shows the value of a stock over time and allows you mouse over to see the value of a specific day. Unfortunately, the interface is still rather simple as adding your own personal investments is a multi part process of first adding the stock, clicking on the transactions button, pressing the "+" button, putting in your information (purchase date, quantity, cost) and finally clicking around the different textfields hoping your information was saved.</p>
<p>One feature that the release boast is the ability to add more media to a particular transaction. This is great if you want to add a two part receipt, warranty, picture of you standing next to your new purchase or whatever. The problem is that when you click on the media button for that particular transaction, the one window interface becomes even more crowded as it splits the transaction panel in two. </p>
<figure><img alt="Looks alright on my iMac, but too cluttered on my 13'" src="iFinance_media.png" title="Adding media to a transaction"><figcaption>Looks alright on my iMac, but too cluttered on my 13'</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ultimately, I have to say that this release maintains the 2 1/2 mouse rating it was given originally based off of the continued frustration with getting information into the application and overall user experience.</p>

<p>Nowadays, it seems like everyone is wrapped up in his/her own group of social networks. There's twitter, Facebook, google+, and even myspace; for those of you who are still looking for interesting ways to use the blink tag. The blink tag itself was part of the excitement of the internet at that time and every beginning textbook or html class had an example of how to "best" use it (Hint: Never). Another annoying aspect of being on the internet at that time were the Signatures placed in your outgoing emails. I can understand that a company wants to advertise that they provide free email, but shouldn't the fact that I sent the email via hotmail.com or yahoo.com be enough? To top it off, a lot of free email providers, at the time, where smashed by an assortment of issues like demand for more space and functionality (POP, IMAP, Address Book, etc) and the dreaded SPAM. </p>
<p>Personally, I was more than excited to get a google mail address (Does anyone else call it that?) and only logged into my old account to look at all the spam to remind me of how good I have it now.</p>
<p>Well, Yahoo! has slowly turned the situation around. The first thing they did was offer free IMAP and contact synchronization to iPhone users. This was great if you had an iPhone, but if you were a regular user you still had to use the web interface if you wanted to send an e-mail, unless you paid for Yahoo! Mail Plus. </p>
<p>Then wonders upon wonders, Yahoo opened up <a href="http://www.ymailblog.com/blog/2011/07/yahoo-offers-mail-contacts-instant-messaging-and-calendar-sync-for-apples-new-osx-lion-operating-system-allows-for-unique-contacts-sync-with-macbooks/">IMAP free for everyone</a> and eliminated the mountains of spam that onceI get. All without that little signature at the bottom that tells people I'm sending email from the '90s.</p>
