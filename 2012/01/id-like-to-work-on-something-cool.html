<p>The problem (other than follow through) is finding something cool to work on. It is sooo much easier to look at what I <em>don't</em> want to work on. </p>
<p>Recently, I went back to school to get some more 'learnin' and it was actually a lot of fun after the initial issues not having been in a class room since 2004. The [professor][chang] was not only knowledgable but actually cared about teaching understanding. For a second, I even thought about going back to school so that I could teach as well.</p>
<p>The most important thing about it was that I really got back into the passion of programming. I enjoyed completing the assignments and working with a group of people towards a common goal. </p>
<p>That is what I want to do.</p>
