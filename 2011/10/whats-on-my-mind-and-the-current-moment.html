</header><h2>The maps.</h2>
<p>My wife wants me to pick up some maps for her presentation tomorrow. It's really important to her because she's emailed me twice and called at least once to confirm that I'm going to pick them up. Part of me wants to pick them up and pretend I was able to so that I can surprise her later tonight. </p>
<p>I won't because it's not right. I wouldn't want her to do something like that to me and we should always treat people the way we wanted to be treated. </p>
<h2>Finding the time</h2>
<p>I sometimes find myself wondering "Where did the time go?" or "When am I going to be able to do that?". But what it call comes down to is "What is important to me". </p>
<p>Do I take the time to set a goal of 250 or 15 minutes a day or do I sit back and relax with a video game? </p>
