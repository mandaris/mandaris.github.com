<p>I recently sent an email to Andy Ihnatko, a really cool journalist from the Chicago Sun Times and Macbreak Weekly. I thought it was pretty good and I&#8217;d like to post it to you the internet!
(Note: I didn&#8217;t take the time to do a second draft this is all from the top of my head).
Hello Andy, I&#8217;m a fan and a happy mac user. I&#8217;ve heard a lot of arguments that I&#8217;ve paid too much for my mac, but I can&#8217;t think of a time when I had to worry about this or that not working. Anyway, you&#8217;ve probably heard and experienced this story&nbsp;yourself.</p>
<p>The point of me emailing is that I&#8217;m having a hard time arguing with my co-workers in regards to the iPhone. I got one and I love it, the thing is testimate to modern computing and we wouldn&#8217;t even be having a discussion about &#8220;smart&#8221; or &#8220;feature&#8221; phones if it hadn&#8217;t come to&nbsp;pass.</p>
<p>It seems to me, that a lot of the talk after google <span class="caps">IO</span> were complaints against Apple not being open and that the web wanted to be free, but it seems that no one brings up the fact that the very first applications that third party developers could put on the iPhone were <em>gasp</em> web apps&nbsp;that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Free to&nbsp;develop</li>
<li>Free of censorship from&nbsp;apple</li>
<li>Freely available to everyone and can run on (basically) any webkit based&nbsp;browser</li>
</ol>
<p>I can understand some of the frustration that some of the developers are experiencing when it comes for submitting there application, but it seems kind of silly when somebody complains that she or he can&#8217;t use tool Z on product i so they want to have nothing to do with it (or cancel a national&nbsp;conference).</p>
<p>To me, I&#8217;m reminded of someone saying they want to run their playstation games on a nintendo, but then I look at the people who are actively complaining and I wonder how many of them are console&nbsp;gamers.</p>
<p>One other thing, I&#8217;m tempted to buy the playboy application and do a little blog post about it, because I keep Leo talking about how apple is being hypocritical on their porn policy. I don&#8217;t think this is true, because the applications that were taken off the store all contain nudity. The description on the playboy application says that it doesn&#8217;t explicitly. The only thing is that I&#8217;m afraid my wife might beat me if she sees it when she syncs here ipod touch, but I think I could get away with it if a respected journalist said I should in order to get the inside&nbsp;scoop.</p>
<p>Lastly, I&#8217;d like to thank you for doing what you do. You explain your arguments a lot better than I do and it comes across and solid reasoning. I hope that you&#8217;ve read this and&nbsp;smiled!</p>
<p>Salutations!</p>
