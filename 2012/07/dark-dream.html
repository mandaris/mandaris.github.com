<p>I could hear people walking across and i knew who they were.</p>
<p>They were being judged and they were going to heaven.</p>

<p>"how can i find my pashion," i yelled.</p>
<p>he almost spat out his coffee... </p>
<p>he readjusted himself in the chair and repeated the question as if i hadnt said anyhting.</p>
<p>i felt like i was doomed and helpless. that nothing i said or did would change anything...</p>
<p>i feeling that im too familiar with...</p>
<p>and then the alarm went off.</p>
