</header><p>I don’t think society OKs me saying this but I love making passionate love to my wife.</p>
<p>She’s good at it and I love doing it with her.</p>
<p>When it’s great.:
Which is actually turning into a question because we’ve been having a couple of issues in the bedroom. Sometime it great and sometime both of us are left laying there unsatisfied.</p>
<p>I know I’m not the only one this has happened to. A multimillion dollar industry is aimed at couples, women and men trying to improve what they have in the bed room or at the very least make <em>something</em> happen.</p>
<p>We’ve done a couple things like read books, play games and even watch a movie or two, but I’m coming to the conclusion that we are missing that little spark that used to set us off. Sure, we have are little sessions here and there but I feel that we’ve drifted apart in some ways and it doesn’t feel like we are making love to each other but only attempting to satisfy our desires.</p>
<p>But how do we do that? How do I take the woman who nurtures my kids and kisses there owies and do all the little things I wanted to do when we were dating?</p>
<p>Is it me? Am I the one who is having trouble identifying that woman I married as the same woman who I couldn’t get the clothes off fast enough?</p>
<p>Part of it is that I can’t get my mind on all the thoughts about being in adequate and into the moment where it is just two people trying to connect.</p>
<p>Before the kids wake up.</p>
