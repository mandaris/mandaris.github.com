</header><p>Today for my creative challenge, I'm going to write 250 words! </p>
<p>I was sending and tweet to Matt Gemmel (a developer who has transitioned to being a writer) asking what kind of exercises does he do to improve his writing. He stated that he writes about himself in third person and then does some fan fiction as well. </p>
<p>I'm going to do something similar to that because I have some desire to be a little bit of a writer as well. </p>
<p>Of course it was part of a dream that I've given up, but I think I should at least work on making it an option. Being able to express my thoughts, feelings and ideas can only help me interact with other people.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I get lonely and I don't know if anyone feels the same way that I do about a lot of things. If I write about what I think, I might find others like me who feel the same way about it.</p>
<p>Or even better, I can understand my own feeling about something and work towards getting a grasp of it. Understand it and do something about it if it is negative.</p>
<p>One last goal is to be able to write for another publication. I feel that I have a unique way of seeing things sometimes. Some of the reports and snippets that I see on the internet are about 250 words and if I could write something that length easily than it would open a lot of doors.</p>

</header><p>Last night, I spent some time doing research on how to work with exercism.io so that I could create a little video tutorial. From my home computer, I saved the individual webpages into evernote and than made sure that my laptop did a sync of the pages before I left the house.</p>
<p>I think this will work well going forward for my research materials, but<sup id="fnref:but"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:but" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> it doesn't help me when I come up with new outlines and mind maps on my phone. </p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about this problem. On one hand, I have a point of friction. On the other, I'm moving! I'm doing something and this will ultimately be something that I can work on as part of this whole challenge.</p>

</header><p>This time, I set out to see how quickly I could make a video of a simple animation. I managed to put it together in half an hour, but in the rush I can see a horrible delay in the middle of it. I feel it is because I don't really know the controls of the time line and that I was rushing to create something more than a blog post about the challenge that I'm doing.</p>

</header><p>Perhaps I'm fortunate in the fact that I only have half of my self allotted time to create something today.  I got caught up being productive at my job<sup id="fnref:working_hard"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:working_hard" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and the place that I usually set up for this kind of work had the desk and chairs removed.</p>
<p>In fact, that got me thinking of whether I should count things that I make for work as part of my challenge. I think I'll say no at this point because I want to be able to show my work to the outside world and I'd like to keep my job<sup id="fnref:firewall"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:firewall" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

</header><p>So this post is more of a follow up to explain my logic for what I'm doing. Sometimes, it's just good to write out your thoughts.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>I find myself putting more and more of my thoughts into mindmaps. I will have to come up with a way to put them into better drafts.</figcaption><img src="../../images/Create_something_everyday.png"/></figure></p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>What would making something every day do for me?  That was the question that I asked myself. I've been missing something for months if not years and it was the satisfaction that I was creating something meaningful outside of being a parent. I was feeling helpless and I was slowly seeing things not getting done. </p>
<p>I was losing control.</p>
<p>I feel that this will allow me a jump start into taking some control. </p>
<p>As opposed to learning to control my body via exercise and meditation<sup id="fnref:meditation"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:meditation" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>What Counts</h2>
<p>The last two are things that I've never made before and I'd like to make it part of my challenge to get something in front of other people. Honestly, I don't know how many people read my blog anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog Entries</li>
<li>Tutorials</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Examples</li>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Vlog</li>
</ul>
<h2>What doesn’t count</h2>
<p>These are things that I was doing anyway and I don't want to make it part of the challenge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Journal Entries</li>
<li>Tweets</li>
</ul>
<div class="footnote">

</header><p>The first thing that I'd like to work on is getting the article header that I'm using to be more capable of handing meta data for individual entries. Currently, it points to the specific url for the article but I'd like it to take my current header.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">title</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Where</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">put</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">maybe</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">someday</span>

</pre></div>


<p>and add the <code>link</code> attribute</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">title</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Where</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">put</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">maybe</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">someday</span>

<span class="n">link</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">some_other_place</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">com</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I started off with the following jinja heading.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">&lt;h1&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;a rel=&quot;bookmark&quot;</span>
<span class="x">   href=&quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.url</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot;</span>
<span class="x">   title=&quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.title</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="nf">striptags</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"> «</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">SITENAME</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">»&quot;&gt;</span>
<span class="x">   </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.title</span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To be honest, I don't do development on the blog that often so I used my own code to look up how to do an <code>if</code> statement in jinja and wrote a little test line to see if it worked.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.title</span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">article.link</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.link</span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endif</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>After editing the page a number of times and doing more research that I should have into which kind of <code>rel</code> tag I should use for book marks versus external links, I finished up with this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">article.link</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot;</span>
