</header><p>Well, it seems like even <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/19/showbiz/paula-deen-racial-slur">Paula Deen</a> has said it too. And it looks like a lot of people have a strong reaction to this. Her sponsor has dropped her and even the food network has severed her ties with her. "People" -I use the term loosely- are going back on forth on forums about how it's unfair to do this to her because some of the best selling rappers use the word like a particle of speech. </p>
<p>Personally, I think the outrage is too much. Doing this isn't helping race relations.</p>
<h1>History?</h1>
<p>I'm not going to give you a history lesson on the N-word. Most people in America already know what it means. If you don't know what it means, take some time and watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075572">Roots</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853728">Django Unchained</a>. </p>
<p>All I can think about are my own experiences.</p>
<h2>My experiences</h2>
<h3>People yelling it out of cars</h3>
<p>Most of the times that I've heard the N-word shouted at me was when I had someone drive past me and yell the word from a moving vehicle. I've had people throw things at me as they were doing it. </p>
<p>One instance was when our neighbor's boyfriend had yelled it at me after I had threatened to call the cops on him for yelling at his girlfriend. </p>
<p>None of these people knew anything about me other than I was black.</p>
<h3>Children Yelling at Each Other</h3>
<p>Sometimes, when I take my kids to the park I hear some of the younger kids say it to each other. Sometime to intimidate and anger each other and other times as a general insult.</p>
<p>I sometimes see how some of the children will gang up on the other and use it in hopes that the one being teased (usually a smaller kid and never the largest) will fight back.</p>
<p>I wonder if the kids are mimicking TV or just there life at home and feel sad for them that this is what they do when their parents are around.</p>
<h3>Entertainment</h3>
<p>I enjoy a lot of things, like music and movies. One of my favorite things to do is to watch a movie or listen to some stand up. In fact, some of my favorite comedians are Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle.</p>
<p>All three of them have had jokes that can be considered derogatory<sup id="fnref:unfunny"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:unfunny" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. </p>
<p>When it comes to movies, a lot of the "black films" that I've seen in recent years have had the phrase "Nigga, please" or some kind of derivative. </p>
<p>I remember a couple times, when I've had "discussions" with my parents about how I don't "talk black".</p>
<h3>Conference</h3>
<p>Honestly, the most memorable use of the N-word that I've heard happened when I was at a NSBE conference back in 2003.</p>
<p>The speaker had painted an image of how a group of runaway slaves had been captured by some kind of bounty hunters and how some of them were going to be killed as an example. One of the runaways had just given birth and was pleading to be spared.</p>
<p>The slaver shot her dead.</p>
<p>Then stomped the baby.</p>
<p>And said "Nigger".</p>
<p>As if it was less than trash.</p>
<p>This was a powerful image, because it hit me that the N-word is the same word people would use to kill as to chide. </p>
<p>That makes no sense to me.</p>
<h2>Do other races see it that bad</h2>
<p>I don't know if other races, think about words used for them. And honestly, I've only know a couple. Most notably mexicans.</p>
<h1>What are we going to do?</h1>
<p>Well, we can all jump to arms and point fingers, but I doubt that is going to help anyone out in this situation.</p>
<h2>Don't hide it</h2>
<p>I feel we all need to be a little more open to the fact that people are going to say things that we don't like.</p>
<p>And honestly, there are people out there that even the worst words are too good for them. </p>
<p>It is up to all of us to be a little understanding and let people express themselves<sup id="fnref:DontBeStupid"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:DontBeStupid" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> to a degree.</p>
<p>Otherwise, how are they going to learn? And how are we going to know?</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>We have a long way to go in race relations. I consider myself very lucky to be in America and even more lucky to be in California. I know we've made huge strides in equality and learning to live with other ethnic groups. </p>
<p>Still, there is more to this case than just the N-word. The lawsuit that brought this to light talks about other forms of harassment and I think that as human beings we should focus on that in regards to Paula Deen.</p>

</header><p>Tonight, my wife told me that our daughter has an exclusive girl club in her kindergarten class that she isn't allowed to be in. This club has one particular girl in it that is being mean to my daughter. She doesn't like being there <sup id="fnref:aha"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:aha" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It's something that no parent wants to hear, but should listen to now more than ever. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-204_162-3239837.html" title="Girl's Suicide Rate Rise Dramatically">The suicide rate for girls has increased to an alarming level</a> with articles and news clips talking about how girls are being ambushed and beaten by their peers. Then, to add more humiliation, someone records it and puts it on the internet.</p>
<p>Some would say that it's just girls being mean, but I've been bullied and I know how these things can affect you. I only pray that I can help my daughter find the strength that she needs in order to get past this.</p>

</header><p>I've been making little changes with my life in order to get more done instead of just talking about it. One of the changes that I've done is to become more committed to the things that I put into my calendar after hearing a couple great quotes from Merlin Mann's <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w" title="A great Podcast">Back to Work</a> podcast.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A calendar is a map of your time." - Merlin Mann </p>
<p>"Don't let a calendar run your life, use a calendar to help <em>you</em> run your life." - Merlin Mann</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seemed like perfect timing that at the same time that I'm putting more effort into getting things together, one of flagship calendar applications - BusyCal - came out with a <a href="https://support.busymac.com/tickets/15755" title="What's New in BusyCal 2.0">new version</a>.</p>
<h2>Getting Organized</h2>
<p>In the effort to become more organized, I decided that it would be easier on me to start off by placing recurring events and events that I know that I will certainly be attending. The only problem being that I need to review my calendar to make sure that it is up to date and that all the activities on my computer are reflected on the family calendar hanging on the wall of the kitchen. I'm slowly building up the habit of making sure that the two are in sync and in a way this works as a little review of what is going on in my life for the purpose of time management. Another benefit is that I don't commit to a lot of different things because of the hassle it would take to make sure that I'm available at a certain time<sup id="fnref:punctual"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:punctual" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In a way, this has improved how I function in my day to day life because I don't have as much stress about missing appointments. The stress I do have is generated because of my desire to do more things at once. The problem is that I'm getting a better idea of what I want/should be doing and it is kind of scary to see all the different things that are vying for my attention. I've been using <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus" title="One of the most powerful/popular GTD applications in the world.">OmniFocus</a> to help me manage all the projects and I think I've moved a little bit past just pushing things around and doing busy work. I'm learning where things are getting lost and I think thats one of the key things you need to find if you really want to improve your life.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this has really shown me that there isn't a silver bullet to being productive and getting things done. It's a bunch of little bullets being fired from the gun called willpower<sup id="fnref:willpower"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:willpower" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. And I am starting to trust in myself to follow the plan that I have set out. I'm still working on making sure that I do some kind of as often as possible and get things out of my inbox.</p>
<p>But that leads us back to the main point of this post.</p>
<h2>Why did/didn't buy BusyCal 2?</h2>
<p>Honestly, I'm on a budget. When you're constantly checking your balance to make sure that you have enough for food/rent/kids/spouse, it is hard to justify $30<sup id="fnref:cash"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:cash" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. </p>
<p>The other reason is that I already have the first version of <a href="http://www.busymac.com/busycal/index.html" title="BusyCal is an award winning calendar app that provides powerful time-saving productivity tools in a friendly, personalized, easy-to-use package.">BusyCal</a> and <a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical" title="The Mac calendar you'll actually enjoy using">fantastical</a>. Both of these products provide me with all the calendar information that I need at this point. For the current date and to add things, I use fantastical<sup id="fnref:problem"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:problem" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. When it comes to a wider view, BusyCal does that way better that iCal in the sense that it isn't a nightmare to look at.</p>
<p>If I had the money, I'd buy the new version as it looks really nice and company is focused on bringing a great mac experience.</p>

<p>For a while, I would stress out about meeting people up at a given time. I wanted my word to mean something when it came to not being late. If I said 8AM, I meant 8AM.

 #<a href="http://quotidianquest.com/tag/email.html">email</a></span></p>
</header><p>I've been thinking about email a lot more than I would like to during the last couple of days due to my latest attempt to have a GTD based workflow and eliminate some of the friction<sup id="fnref:wonders"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wonders" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in my life. </p>
<p>I know for a fact that email is not really the problem when it comes to managing my life and the thoughts about how to handle the incoming maybe just my minds way of just "moving the food around on my plate".</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong> </p>
<p>This has been a problem for me every time that I get organized. I've been blessed to have two computers and it seems like a lot of trouble trying to get the two to have the same set up because I share one with the rest of the family and the other is my "work" computer that has all the latest do dads and what nots in it.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm at a crossroads when it comes to my feelings about Mail.app and email/Gmail. I have multiple account (3 gmail accounts and 1 iCloud/me.com/MobileMe<sup id="fnref:mobilemess"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mobilemess" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>). I feel that if I can't control this kind of input into my life than I'm not going to be able to trust any kind of system that I set up.  So made a little wish list of all the things that I need from an email client.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard Shortcuts </li>
<li>IMAP/POP for when I "eventually" leave gmail<sup id="fnref:free"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:free" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.  </li>
<li>Scriptable/extendable - I want an easy way to send a link to a message to OmniFocus</li>
<li>Stable - I want the app to do all of this without using plug-ins.</li>
</ul>
<p>So where does this put me? Do I take the time to find that "Perfect" email client? Do I go back to Mail.app attempt to make it fit my imaginary workflow?</p>
<p>After writing all this, I think I'm just wasting my time with a first world problem.</p>
<div class="footnote">

<li id="fn:wonders">
<p>More like distractions. I don't think I had a problem focusing on things until I had was able to get on the internet for longer than two hours in a row.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:wonders" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:mobilemess">
<p>For the longest time, it seemed like the service was constantly going down for hours or days at a time.

</header><p>Well after having nightmares about it for the last couple of nights, I can now rest easy now that the pancake breakfast is over. </p>
<p>And what a breakfast it was, at first things were moving really slowly as the people trickled two and three at a time and I was actually afraid that we wouldn't be able to make enough money to break even with the costs of all the supplies.</p>
<p>And then the boom dropped.</p>
<p>I found myself constantly mixing batter to keep up with a constant stream of hungry customers. In fact, I heard that there was a story of people who went through the line 3 times.</p>

</header><p>Tomorrow, I’m going to be leading the parents of my daughter’s kindergarten class in our first and only fundraiser. </p>
<p>The (in)famous pancake breakfast.</p>
<p>This was an activity that they told us about at the very beginning of the school year (6 months ago) and I’ve honestly have been kind of dreading that this day would come. </p>
<p>It’s not so much volunteering to do it as it is getting the parents to help out. Although our school has a policy where every parent is required to volunteer 40 hours over the entire school year or donate 20 bucks per hour, I feel that not everyone is able to jump on board and help support us with this. </p>
<p>I’m not angry and I understand that not everyone can help this week, but since I’m the one who is responsible for this if it fails...</p>
<p>I’m just happy that the class that my daughter is in has a lot of top notch parents who really want this to succeed and understand that even the little bit of help can go a long way. </p>
<p>Especially if you tell me about it so I don’t go crazy thinking about what could go wrong.</p>
<p>One thing of personal note is that all the stress of the pancake breakfast has gotten me back in front of the computer to write again.  There have been a number of moments that I’ve been wishing for my journal and tonight is one of them.</p>

Which is actually turning into a question because we’ve been having a couple of issues in the bedroom. Sometime it great and sometime both of us are left laying there unsatisfied.</p>
<p>I know I’m not the only one this has happened to. A multimillion dollar industry is aimed at couples, women and men trying to improve what they have in the bed room or at the very least make <em>something</em> happen.</p>
<p>We’ve done a couple things like read books, play games and even watch a movie or two, but I’m coming to the conclusion that we are missing that little spark that used to set us off. Sure, we have are little sessions here and there but I feel that we’ve drifted apart in some ways and it doesn’t feel like we are making love to each other but only attempting to satisfy our desires.</p>
<p>But how do we do that? How do I take the woman who nurtures my kids and kisses there owies and do all the little things I wanted to do when we were dating?</p>
<p>Is it me? Am I the one who is having trouble identifying that woman I married as the same woman who I couldn’t get the clothes off fast enough?</p>
<p>Part of it is that I can’t get my mind on all the thoughts about being in adequate and into the moment where it is just two people trying to connect.</p>
<p>Before the kids wake up.</p>

</header><p>I’ve thought about it. The desires of my life. About what I would I would do if I could do it in an instant. What would I do if I were to snap my fingers and the thing that I wanted were to magically happen; whether it was instantly get into shape or finish that book.</p>
<p>It is in these moments of clarity that I come closer to the reality that if I want to realize these hopes and dreams that I must first start towards them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A journey of a thousand miles began with a single step.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, I’m not going to beat myself up about the steps I haven’t taken. There isn’t any point in doing that. </p>
<p>I’m not going to freak out about what tools to use or what direction to go in.</p>
<p>I’m going to sit here, not afraid of what obstacles and hurdles I may run into or worry that I’m going the wrong way.</p>
<p>I’m going to take this moment and be thankful for the opportunities that I have in front of me.</p>
<p>I’m alive and in good health. </p>
<p>I have a family downstairs reading to each other and living in the moment created by the universe just for them.</p>
<p>When I finish this little piece of writing, I’m going down to be with them knowing that although I have millions and millions of possibilities for things to do, I only have so many moments to be with them.</p>
<p>And that is a kind of peace of mind that money or dreams can’t buy.</p>
