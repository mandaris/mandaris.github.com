</header><p>This time, I set out to see how quickly I could make a video of a simple animation. I managed to put it together in half an hour, but in the rush I can see a horrible delay in the middle of it. I feel it is because I don't really know the controls of the time line and that I was rushing to create something more than a blog post about the challenge that I'm doing.</p>

</header><p>Perhaps I'm fortunate in the fact that I only have half of my self allotted time to create something today.  I got caught up being productive at my job<sup id="fnref:working_hard"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:working_hard" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and the place that I usually set up for this kind of work had the desk and chairs removed.</p>
<p>In fact, that got me thinking of whether I should count things that I make for work as part of my challenge. I think I'll say no at this point because I want to be able to show my work to the outside world and I'd like to keep my job<sup id="fnref:firewall"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:firewall" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

</header><p>I had trouble coming up with something to make today. I usually set up a time to do something right after work, but found myself staring at my phone for 15 minutes thinking about how I couldn't think of anything<sup id="fnref:crossyroad"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:crossyroad" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I spent so time dabbling with CrazyTalk Animator, but didn't want to spend the time customizing a character today. I noticed that there were some properties that I couldn't change using the version that I have on my laptop<sup id="fnref:cost"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:cost" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So, I think what I will do other than make this post is to commit myself to crafting a video on how to do certain exercises using swift. It would mark off a couple of things that I've been wanting to produce and allow me to have a road map going forward. Not just sitting down and thinking "what am I going to make today".</p>

</header><p>Today, I thought I'd document something simple like how I created an alias to render the blog and then port it to my website. I'm writing it out in hopes that something will pop up and say "There is an easier way of doing it!"</p>
<p>The first thing I do for most posts is I open up Byword to write the words that you are seeing before you. If it's something a little more complicated, I might start off in MindNode<sup id="fnref:MindNode"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:MindNode" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and export to Markdown. </p>
<p>I use a TextExpander snippet to set the header and then just start writing and save the file in dropbox.</p>
<p><img alt="The popup window for the TextExpander header for my website." src="../../images/textexpander_window_header_for_post.png" /></p>
<p>The part that I feel needs improvement is finishing the draft. I have a virtual environment set up for pelican that has all the templates and plugins that I've been tweaking to make the site look and behave in the way that I want. This means that any extra syntax or themes don't show up unless I process the markdown<sup id="fnref:marked"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:marked" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To solve this, I've set up a hazel rule<sup id="fnref:rule"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rule" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> to copy over all the files. </p>
<p><img alt="Hazel rule to clone over all the posts and images for the blog" src="../../images/hazel_rule_to_clone_posts.png" /></p>
<p>After that, I can run a local server to see what the post looks like after being processed.</p>
<p><img alt="An iTerm window with the commands that I use to run the development server" src="../../images/running_local_server.png" /></p>
<p>Which leads us to the thing that I created. An alias in my environment to rsync the finished website and push it to github to host.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>alias pub=&quot;pelican; rsync -r /Users/mandaris/Projects/quotidian/output/* ~/Projects/mandaris.github.com&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Well, that was a longer explanation that I was thinking it would be. </p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:MindNode">
<p>I do have iThoughts as well, but MindNode is better looking.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:MindNode" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:marked">
<p>Although, I do use Marked.app to look at the post as I'm writing it. I haven't commited myself to making the my theme and processors work in the appplication.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:marked" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:rule">
<p>To be honest, this hasn't been working like I want it to. I have to manually run the rule. I'll make it a OmniFocus project to get the rules to work properly. I tried using rsync, but got some weird errors when I attempted to put the configuration into github.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:rule" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

</header><p>I think this is it. This is what the Apple App Store should look and feel like going forward. It's easy to install with all the possible apps just living in a folder until you double click to install.</p>
<p><img alt="The Setapp menue looks like a regular folder of application. They are really just small applications that show a preview of what the app is." src="../../images/setapp_selection.png" /></p>
<p>Honestly, I don't know how to put it into words because it was so, so simple and it had all the little applications that I wanted but couldn't bring myself to buy because of the price[^budge].</p>
<p><img alt="A preview of the TaskPaper app in Setapp" src="../../images/setapp_application_preview.png" /></p>
<p>The super sad part about this is that I've taken on a new job where I have to use Windows all day. When I get home, it's family time. Coupled with that is this would be another subscription that I have to keep track of.</p>
<p>For the developers, I hope this works out that they get the money they deserve from all of those people who are sitting on the side lines. </p>
