<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>I once read that there are two job markets. The one where you have to put in a résumé and hopefully get an interview and then there is the one where know of your work and actively pursue you. This site is about me and how I start over and become an expert in programming and learn to be a better person while I'm at it.</p>
