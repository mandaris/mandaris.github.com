</header><p>Well after having nightmares about it for the last couple of nights, I can now rest easy now that the pancake breakfast is over. </p>
<p>And what a breakfast it was, at first things were moving really slowly as the people trickled two and three at a time and I was actually afraid that we wouldn't be able to make enough money to break even with the costs of all the supplies.</p>
<p>And then the boom dropped.</p>
<p>I found myself constantly mixing batter to keep up with a constant stream of hungry customers. In fact, I heard that there was a story of people who went through the line 3 times.</p>

</header><p>Tomorrow, I’m going to be leading the parents of my daughter’s kindergarten class in our first and only fundraiser. </p>
<p>The (in)famous pancake breakfast.</p>
<p>This was an activity that they told us about at the very beginning of the school year (6 months ago) and I’ve honestly have been kind of dreading that this day would come. </p>
<p>It’s not so much volunteering to do it as it is getting the parents to help out. Although our school has a policy where every parent is required to volunteer 40 hours over the entire school year or donate 20 bucks per hour, I feel that not everyone is able to jump on board and help support us with this. </p>
<p>I’m not angry and I understand that not everyone can help this week, but since I’m the one who is responsible for this if it fails...</p>
<p>I’m just happy that the class that my daughter is in has a lot of top notch parents who really want this to succeed and understand that even the little bit of help can go a long way. </p>
<p>Especially if you tell me about it so I don’t go crazy thinking about what could go wrong.</p>
<p>One thing of personal note is that all the stress of the pancake breakfast has gotten me back in front of the computer to write again.  There have been a number of moments that I’ve been wishing for my journal and tonight is one of them.</p>
