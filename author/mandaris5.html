<p>I spent a little time with <a href="http://www.pixelmator.com/mac/">Pixelmator</a> last night and found it to be fairly easy to make something like this.  I thought it would take a while to make something would meet my needs. </p>
<p>I guess it shows that you never know what you can do until you try.</p>
<p>The only thing that I regret is that I went down the rabit hole and spent almost an hour this morning researching formats and dimensions for making my icon <em>perfect</em>. </p>

I don't know how much the writers really had planned, but it's so much fun to think that something is going to happen and then seeing something completely different.</p>
<p>It's also exciting to see my wife come up with her own theories and see the wonder on her face. These are the good times.</p>

<p>A long time ago, I went to a seminar called EmpowerU. Don't bother looking them up because the name has been used by so many different organizations, it would just confuse you to what I'm trying to say...</p>
<p><em>Anyway,</em> I went to a seminar and I really got inspired to make a change in my life and I've been struggling with trying to make sense of where I want to go next.</p>
<p>It feels like all I can think about it just trying to make it to the next week or day. </p>
<p>But that's not thriving, and that's not the example that I want to show my children.</p>
<p>How do I get out of this rut?</p>

<p>Sometimes, getting ready for bed is the hardest thing to do. In my home, nights are the time that we actually get a chance to sit down and do the things we need to do such as pay bills and schedule activities.</p>
<p>My wife has been the one taking care of the bills in recent months. On one hand, it's good because I found myself having trouble keeping track of when and where money was going. The stress and guilt of missing a bill just got worse and worse over the years as expenses continued to grow.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this has caused problems as I feel pushed out of key decision making areas. </p>
<p>We've never been explicit about it but there have been under tones of hostility about money.</p>
<p>I do what I can, I follow the budget that we agree on and be understanding when she's stressed out. After all, I was doing it for years before we switched.</p>
<p>We're in better shape as far as budgetting, but I tread every night we have to go over bills.</p>

<p>I wanted to spend sometime looking at some resources that I came across that I'm going to use to make my site work better with the micro.blog format.</p>
<h4 id="implementing-microblogging-in-pelican">Implementing microblogging in pelican</h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://ascraeus.org/implementing-microblogging-in-pelican/">Link</a></strong></p>
<p>This one was pretty interesting in that it was the first link in my search and let me know that it was indeed possible. Unfortunately, the site has moved from <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">pelican</a> to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> and I couldn't find the theme in the users github repository (unless he's renamed it).</p>
<h4 id="microblogging-with-pelican">Microblogging with pelican</h4>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.bellebcooper.com/microblogging-with-pelican.html">Link</a></strong> 
This link seems a little more promising as the writer is still actively using pelican to generate her site. Not only that but she has a couple example iOS workflows that give me ideas on how to quickly generate posts for the site. </p>
<p>Currently, I don't have any bandwidth to do any of these options in the next couple of days, but I hope that by writing about them here someone else can use them to make their site better.</p>

</figure>
<p>When I'm trying to come up with a new theme for my blog, I like to think about the different scenerios of what I can put together. I admit that a lot of what I design is rarely shown in my daily writing, but I like the possibilities of expressing myself in this way and part of me hopes that someone else will see my theme and use it or make it better.</p>
<p>In light of this, I don't like using my own content sometimes because I don't always have something recent to test with a theme with.</p>
<p>That's why I took some time and created a repo just for this purpose. I present:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mandaris/pelican-test-content">Pelican Test Content!</a></p>
<p>It's a couple of articles and pages that I use to simulate a website in pelican. It looks like most of the <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes">theme designers</a> create their own set of test data but I'm hoping that this can be the seed or at least add on to whatever else is available. </p>

<p>I like Byword for writing. It has a very simple interface that I've come to associate with writing. When I want to just sit down and let my fingers put the words in, I find myself drawn to this application. </p>
<p>I've tried others but I feel my brain is now weird to think that writing = byword.</p>
<p>The only problem is when I'm out and about and I just have my phone. I don't really have a comfortable way for me to put something like this blog post together without my laptop. I'll have to come up with something.</p>

<p>Well, it's almost that time to tell the women in my life how much that I love and appreciate them. I often think about how the person that petition for the day to be a holiday soon tried to stop it.</p>
<p>Life is funny that way.</p>
<p>We should all appreciate those we care about on a daily basis. That goes without saying but I also feel that it gives us all a chance to get out of our daily routine and do something a little more than a thank you grunt.</p>

      Westworld S2E3 Thoughts

  </h2>
</header><div class="e-content post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>So, I've been really digging Westworld and I created this diagram to just contain some of the high level thoughts that I've been having regarding the plot.</p>
<figure><img alt="Westworld Season 2 Episode 3 connections." src="images/westworld-S2E3.png"><figcaption>Westworld Season 2 Episode 3 connections.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'm just going to write a couple things and I'm not even going to take the time to spell check or get the right names for characters.</p>
<h3 id="children-in-westworld">Children in Westworld</h3>
<h4 id="dont-see-many">Don’t see many</h4>
<p>I feel that this is more than just the logistics of having a show that takes month to produce with a significant amount of time between seasons. Coupled with the fact that the show itself has some very mature subject matter. Maybe I'm reading too much into it but...</p>
<h4 id="all-of-the-ones-weve-seen-have-been-creepy">All of the ones we’ve seen have been creepy</h4>
<p>In the first season,  Lawrence's daughter was the first that I recall saying that the Maze was not for the Man in Black. In this season, we have a creepy Young Ford. 
There are no coincidences. </p>
<h3 id="india-world">India World</h3>
<p>Seriously? I feel that the writers just wanted to show an elephant.</p>
<h4 id="how-is-it-spreading">How is it spreading?</h4>
<p>Whatever it is that is making the hosts turn on humanity is spreading fast. I don't know if it's Ford's last command or the trigger word that is setting them off.</p>
<h4 id="who-is-that-lady">Who is that lady?</h4>
<p>I don't even remember her name. How is it that all the people sent to infiltrate the park are women? Don't get me wrong, I find it a welcome change from what I normally watch.</p>
<h5 id="why-does-she-look-so-much-like-teresa">Why does she look so much like Teresa?</h5>
<p>Maybe all smokers look a like to me, but a lot of her mannerisms remind me of Teresa. It might be why she's willing to shoot someone just to make sure. :)</p>
<h5 id="is-she-dead">Is she dead?</h5>
<p>I don't think so. She's too compelling to just throw away.</p>
<h3 id="dolores">Dolores</h3>
<p>Yes, I went and looked up the right way to spell it.</p>
<h4 id="how-much-of-her-is-wyatt">How much of her is Wyatt</h4>
<p>It seems like she goes back and forth. I would think that Wyatt wouldn't be as much of her personality because a lot of her experience has been as Dolores.</p>
<h4 id="teddy-trouble">Teddy Trouble</h4>
<p>Teddy, Teddy, Teddy... He's just as confused as we are.</p>
<h4 id="is-the-ghost-nation-her-army-or-are-we-just-seeing-wyatts-minions">Is the Ghost Nation her army or are we just seeing Wyatt’s minions</h4>
<p>I don't know. I feel that a lot of them are just following the narrative that was given to them before the end of season 1.</p>
<h3 id="bernard">Bernard</h3>
<p>I like him thus far. I don't know where we're going with this character but it's going to be interesting to see.</p>
<h4 id="not-arnold">Not Arnold</h4>
<p>I'm pretty confident in this. Seeing as he was made after Arnold passed away. I would think that Ford would have a lot of influence on what I would think be his most sentimental creation.</p>
<h3 id="maeve">Maeve</h3>
<p>For me, I'm seeing Maeve as more of a vehicle to see more of the park at this point. I know it is important for her to get her daughter, but we don't know if it will pay off. Please see my small section on creepy kids.</p>
<h4 id="hector-vs-sizemore">Hector vs Sizemore</h4>
<p>I think that this might actually come to a head soon. I'm currently re-watching the first season and I remember how Sizemore was very excited about the speeches and characterization of Hector. It would be nice to see what happens next.</p>
<h4 id="fear-the-ghost-nation">Fear the ghost nation</h4>
<p>The ghost nation is really haunting. I don't know what is going on with them either.</p>
<h5 id="what-happened-in-her-previous-incarnations-how-many-times">What happened in her previous incarnations? How many times?</h5>
<p>Those reveries are really popping up. I think one podcaster was saying it echoes PTSD.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-they-owe-to-each-other-now-bernard-and-dolores">What do they owe to each other now?  Bernard and Dolores</h3>
<p>I feel that of the three major host characters, these two have the strongest connection. Although one sided, they have a history. Does Doloris share some of her memories? Does Bernard attempt to emulate Arnold going forward? I don't know but I'm interest in finding out.</p>
