</header><p>Respect is very valuable to a relationship. When we decide to trust someone with our hearts there is a rule, either spoken or commonly understood, that the two people in the relationship will respect each other as human beings. Sometimes we forget, sometimes we take each other for granted, but if you continue to disrespect your partner, you're going to have some real problems.</p>
<h3>On the Hunt</h3>
<p>In other news, I'm wondering how all of this is going to pan out. Time is running out...</p>
<p>I've thought about what kind of goals I'd like to reach in the next couple of days and I think they are pretty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T">S.M.A.R.T</a>.</p>
<h3>Training Others</h3>
<p>I'm still training my replacement at my current job and it has definitely been a unique experience for me. To me, I see this as more evidence of our disposable culture. My employer sees me as a tool that can easily be replaced. This flies in the face of my goal of being someone that doesn't need a rèsumè in order to get hired. </p>
<p>As far as the company is concerned, this is standard business practice. A way to cut cost by not paying benefits and then being able to let people go without any remorse. </p>
<p>Listen, if you don't like it. You don't have to work here.</p>
<h4>Project Development</h4>
<p>I'm kicking around a couple ideas at the moment and they will continue to be ideas for the foreseeable future due to some time contraints I'm under. I don't want to put anything here because that would be another commitment that I've got to think about. </p>
<p>I'll just add it to OmniFocus for now.</p>

</header><p>My wife's sister has just had a horrible experience attempting to get her car fixed. The problem all started when she had a car accident one night<sup id="fnref:car crash"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:car crash" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and the car was totaled. Others would have cut their loses then and there, but I think that because this was the first car that she bought with her own money she saw it as something worth saving<sup id="fnref:saving"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:saving" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and has literally spent enough money in repairs that she probably could have bought a new one.</p>
<p>I really feel sorry for her. The world does not have an easy way of telling us wether or not something is good deal and when it comes to mechanics, even if they are honest, it doesn't mean that they know what they are doing. I've run into my fair share of people who simply want to make the most money they can from you. I've heard people say that the price for anything is "what the customer can afford". </p>
<p>What are we doing to each other? It seemed like "Honest work for honest pay" is a forgotten concept in our ever consumer focused world.</p>

</header><p>Today, I met my replacement at work.</p>
<p>He's a lot older than I expected<sup id="fnref:expected"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:expected" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> which got me worried. How bad is it out there to find a job?</p>
<p>But it also got me thinking about how our disposable culture. How is it even though everyone seemed to like me at work that I'm still facing a hard end date for leaving and finding something else. I was part of the team, a reliable rock that could get things moving...</p>
<p>But in a couple weeks, I'll be gone and that person I trained will be doing what I did for them. </p>
<p>Honestly, I don't blame the guy and <em>some</em> people have said that I should withhold some of the knowledged that I've accumulated along the way, but I won't do that because I don't need the bad karma and I'm not in the business of burning bridges. The guy is actually pretty nice and was quiet and just soaked up what I was telling him.</p>
<p>He generally liked my teaching style<sup id="fnref:teach"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:teach" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and we even had a great discussion about how development works. I spent a lot of time explaining things and it was nice to show someone all the little things that I have to do every day. I wish him the best, but I wish for better things going forward.</p>

</header><p>This weekend, was good to me. I managed to spend sometime with my family, get some rest and look for a new job without feeling that I was cheat so other important goal. Still, I don't think that new job is going to fall into my lap, but I'm optimistic that if worse comes to worse, I can find something to keep the lights on and make sure that my family isn't hungry.</p>
<p>I believe in myself and I believe in the power of family. </p>
<p>When I write it down it does sound like and affirmation, but I don't see that as a problem. What is wrong with having a positive attitude? It seems that a lot of people don't feel the need to grasps the importance of simply enjoying the moment. Like they  are saving all the happy moments for some grand retirement in the bahamas.</p>
<p>Well, I can tell you this now.</p>
<p>Nothing is guaranteed and -honestly- nothing is "deserved".</p>
<p>Not the retirement. Not happiness. Not even that career for working your ass off in college. People change, plans change. If you haven't heard this yet, I'm sorry to busrt your bubble and be <em>that</em> guy.</p>
<p>For example, I was always told I was smart. I was told that I'd go far in life. I played by the rules given to me and ultimately my career has not come to fruition (just yet). </p>
<p>The only things in this world that I have at this point in life is the love of my family and friends. It is partially for them that I'm able to get up in the morning and I'm grateful. </p>
<p>Sure, it isn't guarunteed that the will be in the greatest of moods, but there is love there.</p>

</header><p>Everyone woke up late today. This is the second time in less than a week that my wife woke up before I did. Maybe I'm losing my touch, maybe I'm just that tired, my fear is that I just don't care as much. For a little more than a year, I've been getting up early to get everyone up so that we can start the day. I dress my children and get lunches ready and this is no easy task when you take into consideration that I'm trying to round up sleepy 2 and 4 year olds. </p>
<p>It really makes me respect single mothers who have to do this all by themselves everyday.</p>
<p>Recently, my youngest has become more and more fussy and I'm having trouble dealing with it. I get the impression that she doesn't hear the word no from other people because that's usually what will set her off on a tantrum. Part of me thinks this has more to do with the fact that she doesn't have a lot of her own activities. As a family, we don't have a lot of time together so a significant portion of it is used to take the oldest one to her events because they don't have a lot of things for a 2 year old to do. I've been thinking about what things I can do so that she gets her own time. </p>
<p>My wife and I have been watching Don Juan DiMarco for the last couple of weeks and it has really made me think about what it means to be romantic. I feel it streams from passion. It is the passion we have for each other and the passion that we have for life itself that makes romance possible.</p>

</header><p>Today marks the one week aniversary of my 250 words project and I have to say that I'm not only proud of what I've done but very thankful to have done it. Honestly, when you look at all the new habits that people attempt to start every year, I think this one is not only reasonably attainable but one of the most personal. Sometimes, I think about what kind of legacy I'm going to leave and wether or not my children will really know who I am as a person. Maybe they can read over some of these entries and get a better insight over who I am.</p>
<p>In other personal news, I met up with my dad today and he asked that I attempt to reconnect with my brother and call my mother more. I've tried multiple time with my mom and everytime the situation gets worse. I feel that somewhere along the line we disconnected (way before I went to college) and don't know how to communicate on a deeper level then wishing each other well. </p>
<p>My brother...</p>
<p>The last thing he intentionally<sup id="fnref:intention"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:intention" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> said to me was "Fuck You, Mandaris". That was on my birthday and that is where our relationship stands.</p>
<p>Other than that, my dad also said I should go to grad school and made a compelling argument that it would help my career. I told him I'd think about it.</p>

</header><p>Recently, my wife has been listening to the Stephanie Plum audiobook series<sup id="fnref:series"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:series" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and we've both been delighted to have something more to talk about other than typical parent stuff.</p>
<p>Then I heard that they were going to make a movie out of the first book and that the trailer was already online. We even set aside some time to sit down and watch it together.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>We're already disappointed.</p>
<p>I don't understand why people continue to give this lady movie rolls. Katherine Heigl plays the same uptight woman who "just needs to find the right one so she can relax and enjoy life (AKA get some)". For some reason she reminds me of Lisa Kudrow because I don't see her in anything else but the same role. Listen, I get it there are a lot of people who are uptight and need to relax, but I'm sure a lot of those people still have a fully working personality. Personally, I think the best thing about the trailer is that she only says a total of 4 lines in the whole thing so I'm hoping that this will be like her other movies and she'll be helped by the other actors (queue "Knocked Up").</p>

</header><p>I recently came across as <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hyde-dev/browse_thread/thread/db9213433190487f" title="Message post from Google Groups">email</a> from a goggle group that I'm part of that is centered around <a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde" title="Hyde on GitHub">Hyde</a> which is what I'm currently using to statically generate my website/blog. The email was basically asking "What's up with the docs?" and all I can do is just shake my head in agreement. </p>
<p>The problem is that a significant amount of these open source projects are created by people whose talent is mostly with the creation of the tools and not with the associatated docs. This leaves a lot of people in the dust because people see the end result and want to have something cool like that, but don't have the time/desire to dive into the code and learn how it works. </p>
<p>It's not because they are lazy, it because we are all busy people and sometimes we don't need to know every aspect of something to use it. For example, you don't have to be a mechanic to drive your car<sup id="fnref:car"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:car" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Honestly, I wish I could help this guy out because I've had similar problems with this and other projects and it can be daunting to stick your head out and ask the questions. But you have to have the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/12/01/courageous-sucking" title="Photography, and the Tolerance for Courageous Sucking via 43folders">courage to suck</a> in order to get any better at something.</p>

</header><p>In the past, I've thought about becoming my own boss and running a small business where I make up the rules and direct my energy and focus on something that I enjoy. True, starting out, I would probably have to submit myself to the whims of whatever customers I'd potentially have, but I have a desire to have more control over my career. Not saying that people who work for others don't have that kind of control, so much as to say that I've met more than a few people who want have expressed thoughts of "why did they do this or that" at all the companies I've been at<sup id="fnref:company"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:company" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Recently, I've come across a job posting for a programming position at Intel and wanted to apply for it. If I get selected for an interview and get past that there is a programming test with a catch<sup id="fnref:catch"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:catch" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>...</p>
<p>... <em>IF I FAIL</em>, not only will I not get hired. I won't be able to interview with Intel again for an undefined time. </p>
<p>Now, I understand why Intel has done this there are a lot of people out there looking for jobs who look good on paper and may do well in an interview. How do you reduce the amount of people you have to look at if there is a chance that someone who bubbled up from the heap comes back?</p>
<p>It is making me pause.</p>
<p>But my final thought is, I could apply and not get the job or I could sit here and do nothing garuntee I won't get it.</p>

</header><p>So I'm messing around with plaintext to see how it might fit into my workflow. It seems like it moves pretty fast. I.m going to try simple note late on and see if that makes for a better experience when it comes to writing.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm leaning more towards a Dropbox based solution because that has a versioning system and that will help me... Some how?</p>
<p>Had a great conversation with my wife about a lot of things. What I liked best about it was we weren't talking about something important but that we listen to each other. Two individuals who wanted to share their thoughts and opinions, it's something we definitely need more of because I don't want to wake up one day next to a stranger.</p>
