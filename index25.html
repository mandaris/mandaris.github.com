<p>Well, it seems that I’ve allowed myself to get caught up in the drama again, but I feel like a much better person. I vaguely remember someone once saying that its how we deal with events that define us. I had some very interesting things happen to me since the last time I did a review.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I got sick again. This time it was really bad and I couldn’t leave the bathroom for more than an hour or two before my stomach emptied itself. I don’t think I’ve been sick like that in years and I’m seriously considering talking to my doctor about why I’ve been getting sick so often. My wife says that it might be all the stress of working, a general level of dissatisfaction with where I am in my life, the relationship between me and my family, the list is long. But I definitely could be worse.</p>
<p>Secondly, pack up the kids, we are moving! We are moving to a two story townhouse that has almost twice the amount of space of our current place. We’re put the deposit down and we’re just waiting for the credit checks and then we’ll be set for the end of the month to move in.</p>
<p>Third, I looked at the number of posts that I did in January(12) and compared it with the number of posts that I did back in 2009 (36) and 2008 (24). Wow, that’s a lot of information to put on “Da Google.”</p>
<p>Forth, I came across a journal that I used to keep up a couple years ago and -honestly- I could write a post about it alone. It was sad that I looked at it and saw that I am still dealing with issues from back then. To sum it up, it’s been more reason to do more in order to move my life forward.</p>
<p>Personal Accomplishments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up </li>
<li>Set up a work journal</li>
</ul>
<p>Things on my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to make it all better...</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, I don't want to say that the honeymoon phase is over, but I will say that things have become a lot more... hectic.</p>
<p>I guess the first day had a lot going for it since I only saw them for 4 hours before it was time for them to go to bed and we were lucky to be able to take them all to the park followed by the library where they can run off a lot of energy.</p>
<p>Yesterday, was different. Thankfully, my mom took the older girls out to the museum and to go eat and when they got back they had cookies and cake. I -in my infinite wisdom- then told my wife that she should go out and take a break from all the kids and although it took a lot of convincing she (although she did take our youngest which I was grateful for later).</p>
<p>After that, things weren't as bad as you would think, but it wasn't perfect either. I was running around breaking up little fights over toys and turns. The kids screaming "NO! It's my turn" and running to the other side of the room because someone is doing something they shouldn't: Spilling things, taking things, eating things, thankfully not breaking things, but I'm sure something has disappeared into that magical land that missing socks go. I even attempted to go over letters with very poor results. I could tell that the oldest one was frustrated, but I hope that I'll be able to get her to recognize most of the alphabet before she leaves.</p>
<p>Eventually, the girls settled and I managed to get them all into bed without the same hassle as the night before. Although, I did have one call me a dozen times for various things until I put my foot down.</p>
<p>One thing of note was although our guest don't seem to get along during the day, the oldest one does show some concern for her sister. I feel sad for them because with all the drama that they've gone through the only one's they truly have is each other. To wrap it up, this time I got to sleep in the bed and had to share it with my oldest.</p>
<p>She threw up on me twice.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after a particularly long series of events. My wife and I have had the opportunity to care for two (2) more girls; one aged 3 and the other aged 1. I won’t go into the details of where we got them or how we got them, but they are here and it’s nice to see how they interact with our girls. Even so, my mind is racing with questions of what would happen if the girls stayed with us. How are we going to do lessons? How are we going to transport them? How are we going to do bed time and showers? Easy, you just take it one day at a time.</p>
<h3 id="things-that-i-noticed-so-far">Things that I noticed so far:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>When little girls get together it seems to always be play time</strong><br>
My wife and I did our best to accommodate. We had to take both cars in order to get them to the park yesterday and it then use the baby bjorns to hold the little ones as we ran around chasing the more mobile of the two. It would have been more fun if we could have done it earlier in the day.
Baths aren’t that hard Bath time was done doing two by two and it wasn’t that difficult, because I’ve found that kids (or at least the ones I’ve seen) like water. If anything it was difficult making them wait their turns and making sure they don’t drown each other.
Dinner Well, it’s a good thing my wife and I have moved away from eating fast food and the like and actively plan and prepare meals in advance. It saves money (2 adults and 4 kids… yikes!) and time (just heat and eat).</li>
<li><strong>Discipline</strong> This was an awkward subject for me to handle. On one hand, I’m a parent who is raising his daughters in a way I feel is right. On the other, these aren’t my children and I don’t know what they are expecting. I don’t spank, but I expect that what I say should be followed. So far, we haven’t had any big issues other than the older one pushing her sister down and a misunderstanding on what it means to share. Strangely enough, it’s my own daughter who's been giving us the most trouble. It could be because she’s two now and wants to express herself with the word “No” or she’s embolden now that we have company.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, I got my eye on her….</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bed Time</strong>
This is actually, where things get a little more tricky. Thankfully, these girls sleep through the night, but it just begs the question of where do they sleep. We pretty much put the oldest one in my daughter’s crib, her sister has her own portable crib and our girls slept with mommy in the bed. Leaving me on the couch and I have to say it’s probably the best night of sleep that I’ve had in days.
Well, that sums up the first day. The second one is today, and thankfully I’m at work for most of it!</li>
</ul>

<p>This week, I’ve been really ill. Maybe it’s all the stress that I’ve been under: Looking for a new place to live, Asking for a raise, unresolved issues with my family, weird sleeping schedule (the kids), pressure to produce <em>something</em>!</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s a quick review:</p>
<p>Accomplishments:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Asked for a raise (Which was quickly followed by questions of “How do you do that special XYZ thing you do?) </li>
<li>Keep my head when I found out my account information was used to make some weird purchases </li>
<li>Make a post to email-init to further information about email clients</li>
</ul>
<p>Things on my mind:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Find a place to live </li>
<li>Work on my personal relationships </li>
<li>Do a deeper review than this</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically the same thing as last week</p>

<p>Today, I got a notification that someone had stolen my account information to buy things online and that my account is going to be closed for the time being. It just goes to show that you have to be on top of this kind of stuff and people will take your money even if you don’t have a lot in the first place.</p>
<p>On top of that, I just got the bill for the fixes to my doorway that was kicked in last year.</p>
<p><em>$326!</em></p>
<p>You must be out of your mind!</p>
<p>Talk about bad timing!</p>

      How I use Email

<p>Recently, Mac Developer Brent Simmons discussed on his <a href="http://inessential.com/2010/01/16/email_init">blog</a> about the importance of a good email client. Although, he said he wouldn't spearhead the project, he did start up a mailing list (ironic) for it. The list has been going crazy with people going back and forth over what the ideal mail client was and what should be in the 1.0 release.</p>
<p>One of the posters, Matthieu Cormier, has posted on his <a href="http://www.preenandprune.com/cocoamondo/?p=795">blog</a> how he uses Mail.app and I thought it would be a good exercise to re-evaulate how I use mail and maybe that would help move the discussion along.<br>
<img alt="A diagram of my mail usage" src="email.png" title="Diagram of my mail usage"></p>
<p>Last year, I made the switch from .mac to gmail and it's been kind of interesting to see how Mail.app handles mail. Before this point I was having gmail send all my email to my mac address and then using <a href="http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html">Act-on</a> to sort it into different folders. This worked alright when I was at home and had time to sort my email, unfortunately, I'm not always on my mac... and <em>sometimes</em> .mac was down.
<img alt="Screen of gmail" src="myEmail_work.png" title="Picture of gmail">
Currently, I only use gmail and I've set up some labels and filters to manage it all. I have emails sent individually so that I can follow different threads quickly.</p>
<p>But I still enjoy working with a desktop client, if only for the sake of it flowing well with the rest of my "workflow" that includes working with omnifocus and a couple other tools that I like to use. If I can add one more issue against Mail.app that I haven't seen mentioned yet is that it doesn't allow you to color the heading on different threads.

<p>Well, thank you for your time!</p>

<p>My wife and I took the kids to Costco today to load up on some of the necessities (namely toilet paper). As it is now fall, Costco has brought out some of their winter wear and my wife was a beautiful peacoat. My wife loves peacoats and has been saying that she would like something new because she's been loosing weight due to her new found passion for running. Like any husband I would love to get her the dress, but we have already bought her two other jackets in the last year plus a Scottevest that we got on sale two weeks ago.</p>
<p>We can't afford it. We haven't a need nor do we have any money in the budget for it.</p>
<p>My wife tries on a few and then sadly places the item back.</p>
<p>That's when my oldest daughter asks why.</p>
<p>I don't even think about it and say, "We don't have the money to buy it."</p>
<p>Instantly, my wife get's angry. Later on we talk about it briefly in the car and she tells me that I should have told our daughter about it in a different way.</p>
<p>"Should I have said, 'We can't afford it'?"</p>
<p>"No, you should say it in a way so she won't misunderstand and get picked on."</p>
<p>I let the subject drop because I'm frustrated. As far as I'm concerned, I told my daughter exactly why we couldn't buy the coat in a way that shouldn't make anyone feel offended. I think it's one of the most important financial lessons an adult (or any one else for that matter) should know. You don't buy things if you can't afford them. If I had learned this lesson earlier or taken it to heart years ago, I'd be in a different financial situation. I don't want my daughters to go down that path an I certainly don't want them to think that they are less because they can't get everything they want.</p>
<p>It's ok to know our limits.</p>
<p>But didn't I just say that I'm guilty of this as well?</p>
<p>Yes, b-b-but...</p>
<p><em>sigh</em> </p>
<p>I've decided to place myself on a spending diet. I've already paid most of my bills for this month. I'm going to set aside $200 for gas and other expenses and place that in a my new Golden1 checking account and see how things go from there. I'm hoping that it helps me realize that the money my family needs to survive is different then the money I use for wantsies. </p>
