</header><p>I'm going to start another challenge for myself of making something everyday. The last time I did this, I challenged myself for a month, this time i'm going to do it for 100 days. I'm going to include blog posts but I'd like them to be good quality posts.</p>

</header><p>I like doing creative challenges. I think back and what I was doing back in December was mostly fun. I want to capture that feeling by blogging and creating things for the next 100 days. It's not hard to do and if anything I'll learn something more about myself.</p>

</header><p>So, I backed the micro.blog kickstarter founded by Manto Reese. It  seems like a really cool project to get involved in. I like the idea of owning my own content when I post on the internet. With all kinds of weird stuff happening on Twitter, I don't know what will happen with the service and whether I want to support something like that.</p>

</header><p>I sometimes look at the things that I’ve accomplished versus the things that I think that I should have accomplished. It’s always in a negative light because you can’t compete with a fantasy like that. </p>
<p>I think that I may actually grow up this year. I might be the person that I really set out to be. </p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>I might be able to look myself in the eye every morning knowing that I did my best for that day.</p>
<p>I’d like to know that my children have had a positive male role model in their life and understand what it means to treat people with respect. And above all, treat themselves with respect.</p>
<p>I think I might have a chance to actually have peace of mind this year. It’s really about me going out there and doing what needs to be done. </p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be a chore. It’s just life and it is up to me to live it.</p>

Your browser does not support the video tag. This is a video of me complaining about the fact that my hair is thinning and I'm feeling old.

<p>Afterwards, I started to pick at the way that I look and sound. Of course, but I'm excited about doing this and making the video better than this one. Small steps, right?</p>

</header><p>Today, I'm having trouble getting started in my alloted time to make something. I really just want to go home, eat and sleep. I think it is because it is the end of the day at the tail end of the week.</p>
<p>I was just going to make a post and call it a night when I remembered that I can make a small video on my laptop and you can see the result below.</p>

<p>This has been on the back of my mind of a while and I thought it would help to get a more formal grasp of what I wanted to do with my up coming video. </p>
<p>I've also been putting together the keynote that I'll be using to back the screen shots and videos I'll be taking. With this being my outline, I think I can start taking the video I need this weekend.</p>

</header><p>Today for my creative challenge, I'm going to write 250 words! </p>
<p>I was sending and tweet to Matt Gemmel (a developer who has transitioned to being a writer) asking what kind of exercises does he do to improve his writing. He stated that he writes about himself in third person and then does some fan fiction as well. </p>
<p>I'm going to do something similar to that because I have some desire to be a little bit of a writer as well. </p>
<p>Of course it was part of a dream that I've given up, but I think I should at least work on making it an option. Being able to express my thoughts, feelings and ideas can only help me interact with other people.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I get lonely and I don't know if anyone feels the same way that I do about a lot of things. If I write about what I think, I might find others like me who feel the same way about it.</p>
<p>Or even better, I can understand my own feeling about something and work towards getting a grasp of it. Understand it and do something about it if it is negative.</p>
<p>One last goal is to be able to write for another publication. I feel that I have a unique way of seeing things sometimes. Some of the reports and snippets that I see on the internet are about 250 words and if I could write something that length easily than it would open a lot of doors.</p>
