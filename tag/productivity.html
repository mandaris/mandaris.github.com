</header><p>A while ago I came across some questions to consider everytime that I do a review of my tasks. The problem is that I've attached the questions to a task in OmniFocus and -honestly- I don't think it's helpful to do something like that unless I think and write about it. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is this system trustworthy? If not, why not? Do I need to make better backups?<br />
No, there are two major problems with the personal productivity. The first is that I don't schedule enough time for something. How can I finish a task when I don't make any time for it. Secondly, I don't do enough positive reviews. I need to do a review every day to make sure that tasks don't fall through the cracks and I don't overwhelm myself. I find most of my reviews are when I'm under the gun. Not a good thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a next actionable task? Can it actually be readily done?<br />
Yes... for the most part. I have a couple projects that have items like "Brainstorm next action".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When do I anticipate looking at this next action’s context?<br />
This goes back to the first question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What will this project look like when it is done?
Depends on the project, baby.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When do I think I’ll need to see this project again?<br />
That also depends on the project.</p>
</li>

</header><p>So for the last couple of months I've been carrying a large spiral notebook that I got from staples. I had planned on using it to capture ideas and as The One Tool<sup id="fnref:tool"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tool" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that would change all of my disorganization into a simple constantly productive life. As will all my new tools it was great for getting thoughts down and being able to read them over. </p>
<p>The only major problem I had was that I could put it in my pocket and just leave right away, I had to have some kind of bag or give up a free hand in order to carry it.</p>
<p>Another thing is that my daughters see it and think "Hey, it drawing time" and now it's halfway filled with their little snippets of stories and artwork.</p>
<p>Personally, it's made it even easier to keep around.</p>

<p>Wow, I can't believe I spent so much time looking into productivity p0rn! I used to look at 43folders.com almost every other hour looking for that "One secret that would make me productive".</p>
<p>The secret, just do it.</p>
