</header><p>There are a couple things that I still have to finish for the website theme plugin. They are margin images and images in the main column. It should be to hard and in fact this post that you are reading is an example of me using it.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm going to put a margin image here on the side followed by a small table of what I had for breakfast the last three days.</p>
<p><label for="margin-figure-id" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="margin-figure-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="../../images/small_me.jpg" alt="This is guy keeps getting better!"/><br/>This is guy keeps getting better!</span></p>

. Now that we got that working we can get the column images working too.</p>
<p>Now to follow up with the column image. I hope that it looks cool in your browser of choice.</p>

</header><p>I recently pushed the button to update my site and push my new theme to the world. It felt good to get it out there because it has been dormant for years now and I had thought about shutting it down sometimes. During the time that I had <em>NOT</em> updated, I had switched jobs and kind of doubted everything I was working on.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, the doubt in my own abilities was part of the reason that it took so long to update because I just didn't think that it was good enough. In my mind, I thought "If it's not perfect than I won't show anything at all".</p>
<p>This is the wrong way of thinking about it. </p>
<p>It's almost childish in a way and reminds me of how I'd refuse to write the steps when I was doing my math homework<sup id="fnref:homework"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:homework" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h1>So now what?</h1>
<p>Well, I've got a new redesign that loads really fast and looks pretty cool. The next steps outside of the technical details that I put in my previous post is to find my direction of the site again.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm using <a href="https://dayone.me">Day One</a> for my journal entries and although this is my personal site I don't think I'll be putting entries from there here (more likely is that this entry will be an entry).</p>
<p>I think I'll probably put links to things that are really cool or some tutorials that I've been thinking about making.</p>
<p>We'll have to see.</p>

<p>It was something that a couple of high school friends would do. We thought it was cool to get the answer completely in our head without writing all the steps of logic down on paper.

</header><p>Today, I've decided that I was going to push my website out to the masses before the end of the week. This is a personal blog and just because it isn't <em>perfect</em> it is something that I created and I want to take pride in the fact that I'm willing to get out there and work on something and make it better.</p>
<p>Some of the things that I'd like to work on will be the handling of navigation at the top and figuring out how to get the tufte style to work properly with pelican. I attempted to get everything working with a liquid tag but the parser doesn't work well with blocklevel tags and wraps it in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> so the expected css doesn't apply properly. This only applies to fullwidth figures but I'd like it all to be uniform.</p>

<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

</header><p>My personal blog hasn't been changed in over a year. I've been waiting for that perfect moment when it would be ready for the world. Unfortunately, it's been stifled because of my own drive for it to be perfect before it sees the world.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't think anyone reads it and it's not going to get better unless I put some time into it.</p>
<p>But before I put any more effort into it, I want to take some time and write about why I should keep it in the first place.</p>
<h1>Web Technology is cool</h1>
<p>I like working on the web. Until this point, I never thought that I'd be considering a career where I'd be working on the web, but I've spent a lot of my life working or playing with something that is some how web related.</p>
<h2>Play around with different tech</h2>
<p>At the bare minimum, having a website allows you to play around with what can happen on the inter-webs and make that part of what people find when they google, bing or duck-duck-go your name.</p>
<h1>My Part of the web</h1>
<p>Ultimately, having your own website is about control. I control the content and what it looks like and if I choose. I can shut it down.</p>
<h2>Vanity</h2>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>All Me.</p>
<h2>Provide a Place to Share My Opinion</h2>
<p>I don't say much, but I know that this is the perfect platform because I choose to write here and I don't have to worry too much about saying "the wrong thing."</p>

</header><p>I recently came across as <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hyde-dev/browse_thread/thread/db9213433190487f" title="Message post from Google Groups">email</a> from a goggle group that I'm part of that is centered around <a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde" title="Hyde on GitHub">Hyde</a> which is what I'm currently using to statically generate my website/blog. The email was basically asking "What's up with the docs?" and all I can do is just shake my head in agreement. </p>
<p>The problem is that a significant amount of these open source projects are created by people whose talent is mostly with the creation of the tools and not with the associatated docs. This leaves a lot of people in the dust because people see the end result and want to have something cool like that, but don't have the time/desire to dive into the code and learn how it works. </p>
<p>It's not because they are lazy, it because we are all busy people and sometimes we don't need to know every aspect of something to use it. For example, you don't have to be a mechanic to drive your car<sup id="fnref:car"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:car" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Honestly, I wish I could help this guy out because I've had similar problems with this and other projects and it can be daunting to stick your head out and ask the questions. But you have to have the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/12/01/courageous-sucking" title="Photography, and the Tolerance for Courageous Sucking via 43folders">courage to suck</a> in order to get any better at something.</p>
