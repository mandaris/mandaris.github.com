<p>I had trouble coming up with something to make today. I usually set up a time to do something right after work, but found myself staring at my phone for 15 minutes thinking about how I couldn't think of anything<sup id="fnref:crossyroad"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:crossyroad">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I spent so time dabbling with CrazyTalk Animator, but didn't want to spend the time customizing a character today. I noticed that there were some properties that I couldn't change using the version that I have on my laptop<sup id="fnref:cost"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:cost">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So, I think what I will do other than make this post is to commit myself to crafting a video on how to do certain exercises using swift. It would mark off a couple of things that I've been wanting to produce and allow me to have a road map going forward. Not just sitting down and thinking "what am I going to make today".</p>

      A simple alias
    </a>
  </h2>
</header><div class="e-content post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Today, I thought I'd document something simple like how I created an alias to render the blog and then port it to my website. I'm writing it out in hopes that something will pop up and say "There is an easier way of doing it!"</p>
<p>The first thing I do for most posts is I open up Byword to write the words that you are seeing before you. If it's something a little more complicated, I might start off in MindNode<sup id="fnref:MindNode"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:MindNode">1</a></sup> and export to Markdown. </p>
<p>I use a TextExpander snippet to set the header and then just start writing and save the file in dropbox.</p>
<p><img alt="The popup window for the TextExpander header for my website." src="../../images/textexpander_window_header_for_post.png"></p>
<p>The part that I feel needs improvement is finishing the draft. I have a virtual environment set up for pelican that has all the templates and plugins that I've been tweaking to make the site look and behave in the way that I want. This means that any extra syntax or themes don't show up unless I process the markdown<sup id="fnref:marked"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:marked">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To solve this, I've set up a hazel rule<sup id="fnref:rule"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rule">3</a></sup> to copy over all the files. </p>
<p><img alt="Hazel rule to clone over all the posts and images for the blog" src="../../images/hazel_rule_to_clone_posts.png"></p>
<p>After that, I can run a local server to see what the post looks like after being processed.</p>
<p><img alt="An iTerm window with the commands that I use to run the development server" src="../../images/running_local_server.png"></p>
<p>Which leads us to the thing that I created. An alias in my environment to rsync the finished website and push it to github to host.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>alias pub=&quot;pelican; rsync -r /Users/mandaris/Projects/quotidian/output/* ~/Projects/mandaris.github.com&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Well, that was a longer explanation that I was thinking it would be. </p>
<div class="footnote">

<li id="fn:MindNode">
<p>I do have iThoughts as well, but MindNode is better looking.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:MindNode" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:marked">
<p>Although, I do use Marked.app to look at the post as I'm writing it. I haven't commited myself to making the my theme and processors work in the appplication.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:marked" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:rule">
<p>To be honest, this hasn't been working like I want it to. I have to manually run the rule. I'll make it a OmniFocus project to get the rules to work properly. I tried using rsync, but got some weird errors when I attempted to put the configuration into github.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:rule" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I think this is it. This is what the Apple App Store should look and feel like going forward. It's easy to install with all the possible apps just living in a folder until you double click to install.</p>
<p><img alt="The Setapp menue looks like a regular folder of application. They are really just small applications that show a preview of what the app is." src="../../images/setapp_selection.png"></p>
<p>Honestly, I don't know how to put it into words because it was so, so simple and it had all the little applications that I wanted but couldn't bring myself to buy because of the price<sup id="fnref:budget"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:budget">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The super sad part about this is that I've taken on a new job where I have to use Windows all day. When I get home, it's family time. Coupled with that is this would be another subscription that I have to keep track of.</p>

<p>I'm lucky enough to have an imac. Unfortantely, I've been having some trouble keeping space free on the machine. So, I took some time to check it how much disk space that I had left when I saw this!</p>

<p>Yes, it does show me that I have some free space, but it doesn't give me anything related to how much of that data I could get rid of or revaluate.

<p>Recently, <a href="https://mandarismoore.com/2016/04/my-thoughts-on-text-expander.html">I posted about my thoughts on Text Expander</a> after they announced that they were going to be moving to a subscription. And I got some feedback regarding what I wrote. I've pasted it below because I honestly don't get any feed back regarding any of my writing<label for="feedback" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="feedback" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Most likely because I do not have comments on the site</span>. </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>I completely agree that they have kind of boxed themselves out of the "casual user" market and are now more focused on "power users" or those that are using this tool on multiple devices (like me)</li>
<li>I think your point is very well written, but would love to see more information about the alternative (AutoHotKey) that you have selected. </li>
<li>Perhaps it would be helpful to mention a couple of things (If any) that could make textexpander that tool for you again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Great job though. You can definitely tell that you care about the company.</p>
<p>It's just they don't fit in your system anymore (which happens)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like feedback. At this point, good or bad I'm happy with the fact that someone else is reading and it gives me some motivation to make the writing better. In this case, I'd like to further expand on the last two points in the reverse order.</p>
<h3 id="3-how-to-make-the-tool-more-helpful-for-me">3. How to make the tool more helpful for me</h3>
<p>This is actually a something that needs to happen on my end<label for="disservice" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="disservice" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">To be fair, the application tries its best to help me be as productive as possible.</span>.  The people at smile give you a number of examples that you can use right away to save you time.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>When I was making this post, I added one more. If anything knowing that I might have to give the application up has sparked new interest in using it. Plus all the the writing that I've been doing.</figcaption><img src="../../images/my_textexpander_setup_2016-04.png"/></figure></p>
<p>The application does help in one major way everyday (when I do use it). Most mornings, I do use it to create my grateful journal template<sup id="fnref:affirmation"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:affirmation">1</a></sup>.  Here is a brief example of the template that I use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code># Things I&#39;m Grateful for #
+ 

# Things I&#39;m Excited about #
+ 

# One Thing I&#39;d like to focus on #
</code></pre></div>

<p>By default, the application will monitor what you type and suggest even more snippets that you can add to your collection.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>I was kind of shocked by some of the things that I write multiple times and it has the possibility of helping me change some habits.</figcaption><img src="../../images/my_textexpander_suggestions.png"/></figure></p>
<p>Maybe, I shouldn't have freaked out when I saw this feature pop up and you can always change the way it works in the preference because it could have been helpful. But it seemed creepy and annoying. </p>

<p>On this topic, I don't have much to say because I no longer have a windows machine to use on a day to day basis. The great thing about this tool was that I was using it to now only fire off extensions but to launch applications and replicate user interactions for testing.</p>
<p>I would often use a keyboard short cut to launch the vnc client because the laptop that was given to employees to use might not be that powerful or we wanted to run a test on another machine that had a faster connection. </p>
<p>For user interactions, I created a script that would type in the keyboard shortcut that would make windows rotate the screen or do a series of mouse clicks to reproduce... something...</p>

<p>While I was writing this, Smile reduced the price to $20 a year for the software. Which changes the deal significantly. Now I have to think about what the software is going to do for me going forward. Is this going to save me time in the future? Will I save more time than the time that I used writing about it here? </p>
<p>I don't know.</p>

<p><a href="https://textexpander.com">TextExpander</a> is a tool that I forget that I have. Actually, TextExpander is a tool that I forget to use. In the last couple of years, I've moved to a workflow that really isn't working for me day to day. I have a laptop, an imac, a couple ipads and all the work computers<sup id="fnref:windows"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:windows">1</a></sup> that have been supplied for me to use in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>Recently, the people at Smile software have switch the software to be a subscription model. On one hand, I understand that some companies need to do this to keep their businesses afloat; the monthly revenue is better to budget against versus someone purchasing the software every major release (maybe). On the other hand, this means that as a user I don't "own" the software; I'm leasing<label for="leasing" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="leasing" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">It seems to be the trend nowadays that people pay a fee to use things from homes(rent), cars and music. I do not have a problem with it, but it seems like a lot of money is going to things that we will not be able to get some equity back from.</span> it.</p>
<p>Honestly, I can see why they would do something like that. The company specializes in tools like this and pdfpen and I like the fact that they sponsor a lot of podcasts that I listen to. I wish them well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be joining them on this experiment. I'm not a power user of the software. Because of the way that I've been living my technical life, I haven't seen myself repeating a lot of text. You can probably see the result of this in the fact that I don't post that often. The header for this posting is stored as a text expander snippet but I find myself having to look it up in order to use it.</p>
<p>I wish them luck and I'm happy to use my current version until it stops working.</p>

</header><div class="e-content post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>So,  I spent about 3 hours working on getting Open Graph tags to work in the theme that I created. I've got mixed feeling about it because I started off by adding the tags to the base html template using an if statement and it seemed a little clunky.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">OPEN_GRAPH</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;meta property=&quot;og:title&quot; content=&quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">SITENAME</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot;/&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;meta property=&quot;og:type&quot; content=&quot;website&quot;/&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;meta property=&quot;og:description&quot; content=&quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">SITE_DESCRIPTION</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot;/&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;meta property=&quot;og:url&quot; content=&quot;</span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">SITE_URL</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x">&quot;/&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endif</span> <span class="nv">OPEN_GRAPH</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This worked for the site in general but doesn't translate to all the articles and this caused me to go into a some what deep dive into how Pelican and Jinja parses blocks and if statements. I started off with putting all the tags into the base and then doing individual changes to tags that need to be changed for. </p>
<p><strong>BAH!!!</strong></p>
<p>So, took a step back and looked into what plugins were already available. And there is was! <a href="https://github.com/whiskyechobravo/pelican-open_graph">Pelican-open_graph</a>! I was home free! Or so I thought, until I tried to use it. The plugin has three problems. </p>
<h4 id="it-doesnt-account-for-when-someone-does-not-have-a-modified-date-on-their-articles">It doesn't  account for when someone does <em>not</em> have a modified date on their articles.</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AntoineVe/pelican-open_graph">Luckily, someone had put a solution up</a>. The change was forked about 7 months ago today and it looks like whoever created the open graph plugin has taken a break to work on other things.</p>
<h4 id="its-a-year-old-and-hasnt-made-the-changes-for-pelican-regarding-summaries-of-articles">It's a year old and hasn't made the changes for pelican regarding summaries of articles.</h4>
<p>So, I had to do some debugging to find out that the code needed to be changed in the following way<sup id="fnref:payitforward"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:payitforward">1</a></sup>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">ogtags</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s1">&#39;og:description&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">instance</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">metadata</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;og_description&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                                                           <span class="n">instance</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">metadata</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;summary&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                                                                                 <span class="n">instance</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">summary</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h4 id="it-also-assumed-that-every-article-has-some-kind-of-tag">It also assumed that every article has some kind of tag.</h4>
<p>I've decided to just punt this problem and add the tags to the 6 articles that don't have them, but than I took a second look at the problem because the perfectionist in me doesn't like to leave problems unsolved and I didn't want to track down what the particular articles were.</p>
<p>So, I just wrapped the code in a try block to make sure that I got this particular exception.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">tag</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">instance</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tags</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">ogtags</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s1">&#39;article:tag&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tag</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">AttributeError</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">ogtags</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s1">&#39;article:tag&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;untagged&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h4 id="results">Results</h4>
<p>Ultimately, I got to learn a little bit more about using pelican and knocked off a major milestone on getting this blog to where I'd like it to be.</p>

<p>Honestly, a lot of people that I respect are talking about it. I think I'm going to have to step through the tutorial again. But honestly, I'd like to think about what I want to do with it. </p>
<p>I already have a couple text editors but I love messing around with the tools more than doing the job sometimes. </p>
<p>The only reason that I don't use sublime text is because of the price. The "free" demo allows you to use it as long as you want but you see a pop up reminding you that it hasn't been purchased yet. I'm not at a point where I can justify the price and being someone who works in the industry, I want to encourage people to pay for software.</p>
<p>I've talked to some other people and it seems like they are proud of the being able to mentally blockout the popup and dismiss it without missing a beat.</p>
<p>To me, that just seems wrong on so many levels.</p>
