<p>I like Byword for writing. It has a very simple interface that I've come to associate with writing. When I want to just sit down and let my fingers put the words in, I find myself drawn to this application. </p>
<p>I've tried others but I feel my brain is now weird to think that writing = byword.</p>
<p>The only problem is when I'm out and about and I just have my phone. I don't really have a comfortable way for me to put something like this blog post together without my laptop. I'll have to come up with something.</p>

<p>Well, it's almost that time to tell the women in my life how much that I love and appreciate them. I often think about how the person that petition for the day to be a holiday soon tried to stop it.</p>
<p>Life is funny that way.</p>
<p>We should all appreciate those we care about on a daily basis. That goes without saying but I also feel that it gives us all a chance to get out of our daily routine and do something a little more than a thank you grunt.</p>

      Westworld S2E3 Thoughts

  </h2>
</header><div class="e-content post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>So, I've been really digging Westworld and I created this diagram to just contain some of the high level thoughts that I've been having regarding the plot.</p>
<figure><img alt="Westworld Season 2 Episode 3 connections." src="images/westworld-S2E3.png"><figcaption>Westworld Season 2 Episode 3 connections.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'm just going to write a couple things and I'm not even going to take the time to spell check or get the right names for characters.</p>
<h3 id="children-in-westworld">Children in Westworld</h3>
<h4 id="dont-see-many">Don’t see many</h4>
<p>I feel that this is more than just the logistics of having a show that takes month to produce with a significant amount of time between seasons. Coupled with the fact that the show itself has some very mature subject matter. Maybe I'm reading too much into it but...</p>
<h4 id="all-of-the-ones-weve-seen-have-been-creepy">All of the ones we’ve seen have been creepy</h4>
<p>In the first season,  Lawrence's daughter was the first that I recall saying that the Maze was not for the Man in Black. In this season, we have a creepy Young Ford. 
There are no coincidences. </p>
<h3 id="india-world">India World</h3>
<p>Seriously? I feel that the writers just wanted to show an elephant.</p>
<h4 id="how-is-it-spreading">How is it spreading?</h4>
<p>Whatever it is that is making the hosts turn on humanity is spreading fast. I don't know if it's Ford's last command or the trigger word that is setting them off.</p>
<h4 id="who-is-that-lady">Who is that lady?</h4>
<p>I don't even remember her name. How is it that all the people sent to infiltrate the park are women? Don't get me wrong, I find it a welcome change from what I normally watch.</p>
<h5 id="why-does-she-look-so-much-like-teresa">Why does she look so much like Teresa?</h5>
<p>Maybe all smokers look a like to me, but a lot of her mannerisms remind me of Teresa. It might be why she's willing to shoot someone just to make sure. :)</p>
<h5 id="is-she-dead">Is she dead?</h5>
<p>I don't think so. She's too compelling to just throw away.</p>
<h3 id="dolores">Dolores</h3>
<p>Yes, I went and looked up the right way to spell it.</p>
<h4 id="how-much-of-her-is-wyatt">How much of her is Wyatt</h4>
<p>It seems like she goes back and forth. I would think that Wyatt wouldn't be as much of her personality because a lot of her experience has been as Dolores.</p>
<h4 id="teddy-trouble">Teddy Trouble</h4>
<p>Teddy, Teddy, Teddy... He's just as confused as we are.</p>
<h4 id="is-the-ghost-nation-her-army-or-are-we-just-seeing-wyatts-minions">Is the Ghost Nation her army or are we just seeing Wyatt’s minions</h4>
<p>I don't know. I feel that a lot of them are just following the narrative that was given to them before the end of season 1.</p>
<h3 id="bernard">Bernard</h3>
<p>I like him thus far. I don't know where we're going with this character but it's going to be interesting to see.</p>
<h4 id="not-arnold">Not Arnold</h4>
<p>I'm pretty confident in this. Seeing as he was made after Arnold passed away. I would think that Ford would have a lot of influence on what I would think be his most sentimental creation.</p>
<h3 id="maeve">Maeve</h3>
<p>For me, I'm seeing Maeve as more of a vehicle to see more of the park at this point. I know it is important for her to get her daughter, but we don't know if it will pay off. Please see my small section on creepy kids.</p>
<h4 id="hector-vs-sizemore">Hector vs Sizemore</h4>
<p>I think that this might actually come to a head soon. I'm currently re-watching the first season and I remember how Sizemore was very excited about the speeches and characterization of Hector. It would be nice to see what happens next.</p>
<h4 id="fear-the-ghost-nation">Fear the ghost nation</h4>
<p>The ghost nation is really haunting. I don't know what is going on with them either.</p>
<h5 id="what-happened-in-her-previous-incarnations-how-many-times">What happened in her previous incarnations? How many times?</h5>
<p>Those reveries are really popping up. I think one podcaster was saying it echoes PTSD.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-they-owe-to-each-other-now-bernard-and-dolores">What do they owe to each other now?  Bernard and Dolores</h3>
<p>I feel that of the three major host characters, these two have the strongest connection. Although one sided, they have a history. Does Doloris share some of her memories? Does Bernard attempt to emulate Arnold going forward? I don't know but I'm interest in finding out.</p>

<p>My children were working on school reports today. I don't know what it is but neither one of them like to work with me on stuff like that. Maybe I'm too critical and don't give them the benefit of the doubt for writing at that age. </p>
<p>Too often, I destroy my own writing for even small things.</p>
<p>Either way, I'm going to do the best to highlight the good things about it and only make suggestions on how to improve when they ask. </p>

<p>I recently saw two tv shows, "AP Bio" and "The Mick", and reliezed that they both attempt to make that the now classic Anti-Hero. The Bad Boy who pretends that he doesn't care but secretly has a heart of gold.</p>
<p>But, the thing about this is that the character needs to have some kind of charisma or redeeming quality. As a viewer with lots of options and little time, I'm not going to wait half a season for that kind of pay off.</p>

<p>On my laptop, I have a TextExander shortcut to make the header for my posts, but I haven't installed it on my iMac because I didn't want it to trigger accidently when someone else is working with it. </p>
<p>I thought I would see how well it works for the time being and move forward with other automations to make posting smoother.</p>

<p>I'm going to spend a couple minutes just writing here. I want to do something more with my time on the computer. </p>
<p>First and foremost, I have to have more of an understanding of where my time is actually going when I'm on the computer. For that, I'm going to use the wonderful <a href="https://timingapp.com/?lang=en">timing.app</a> to track where my time has been spent.</p>

<figure><img alt="Mindmap of what is on my mind." src="images/what-is-up.png"><figcaption>Mindmap of what is on my mind.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I just spent 5 minutes on what are some of the things that are currently on my mind. Honestly, I think I spent more time on the clip art associated with the mindmap than actually thinking about what it means. </p>
<p>I've got a lot of things happening right now and I hoped that putting it in a pretty picture can help me sort it out. So...</p>
<h3 id="whats-up">What’s Up</h3>
<p>Ultimately, I exported the mind map as an outline and decided to  expand it here.</p>
<h4 id="work">Work</h4>
<p>The way that I currently make a living. I find that I'm grinding for someone else and not me or my family.</p>
<h5 id="doing-the-work">Doing the work</h5>
<p>I don't feel that I have a huge problem doing what is asked of me. I <em>do</em> have a problem with the amount of things that need to be done and the amount of support that I'm getting from everyone else. I feel as though a lot of people don't understand that things need to be balanced.</p>
<h5 id="dealing-with-the-people">Dealing with the People</h5>
<p>I do not feel that the people that I'm working with are on the same page. Sometimes, I feel like I'm all by myself on a lot of fronts. I have friends at work, but I also have people who are more into their own ego than getting to the next level in life.</p>
<p>Definitely room for more teamwork. </p>
<h4 id="making-ends-meet">Making ends meet</h4>
<p>Money is absolutely horrible. They say it cannot make you happy, but I find that not having it certainly can make you unhappy.</p>
<h5 id="cutting-expenses">Cutting expenses</h5>
<p>No question. Have to cut back on soo many things. I've started taking my lunch and I've long since stopped buying comic books. The problem is that me and my family like to go out to eat quite a bit.</p>
<h5 id="making-more">Making More</h5>
<p>I've been playing around with the idea of getting a second job. It would have to be a night position, but I don't know if I'd be able to pull it off with the lack of sleep that would eventually happen.</p>
<h4 id="being-fulfilled">Being fulfilled</h4>
<p>This one is just about how I feel about myself. I feel as if I lost my direction in life and I'm really questioning if I had one at all. </p>
<h5 id="what-is-my-current-passion">What is my current passion?</h5>
<p>I like messing around with MacOS X. I love the feel of typing and the pleasure of getting things like my website up and running.</p>
<p>But I want to make something else too.</p>
<p>Not just this blog post but something that can help others, like a tutorial or book.</p>
<h5 id="where-do-i-see-myself-in-the-future">Where do I see myself in the future?</h5>
<p>Unfortunately, the future looks grim. I've got upcoming expenses and less time and resources to deal with them.</p>
<h4 id="having-a-family">Having a family</h4>
<p>The most important aspect. I have a responsibility not just to myself but to other people.</p>
<h5 id="being-able-to-communicate">Being able to communicate</h5>
<p>I want to make sure that my family is able to talk to me if they need to and that I work on my active listening.</p>
<h5 id="making-sure-that-everyone-is-cared-for">Making sure that everyone is cared for</h5>
<p>I love my family and it is important to me that they are happy.</p>
<h3 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h3>
<p>What a small little rant. I feel much better getting that out of my system and will have to review this moving forward.</p>
