</header><p>I sometimes look at the things that I’ve accomplished versus the things that I think that I should have accomplished. It’s always in a negative light because you can’t compete with a fantasy like that. </p>
<p>I think that I may actually grow up this year. I might be the person that I really set out to be. </p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>I might be able to look myself in the eye every morning knowing that I did my best for that day.</p>
<p>I’d like to know that my children have had a positive male role model in their life and understand what it means to treat people with respect. And above all, treat themselves with respect.</p>
<p>I think I might have a chance to actually have peace of mind this year. It’s really about me going out there and doing what needs to be done. </p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be a chore. It’s just life and it is up to me to live it.</p>
