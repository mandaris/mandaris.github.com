    <p>My wife had her wisdom teeth removed last Friday and she's still in pain. They say that if momma ain't happy then no one is<sup id="fnref-momma"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-momma">1</a></sup>, but -other than the occasional rough spot brought by the fact that she's in pain and can't eat- it's pretty smooth.</p>
<p>In fact, it's given me more opportunities to interact with the girls and show them that I can be just as fun as mommy. </p>
<p>For example, my youngest usually screams like a banshee when we clean her hair, but we turned it into a fun game where she got to play with the shower head and squirt around the bath tub. Both of them liked it and we didn't have to clean up buckets of water.</p>
<h4 id="working-out">Working Out</h4>
<p>I also had my second workout at innovative fitness but I think that it could have been better. Most of the exercises are new to me and I'm spending more of my time focusing on the technique versus pushing myself a little bit harder.</p>
<p>My knees have been hurting me when I do lunges and the exercises that the couch has been throwing at us has some kind of lunge. </p>
<p>I think that it might be what's holding me back. I'm scared of pain. I don't want to hurt myself, but it made me think about all the times that I didn't push myself because it hurt.</p>
