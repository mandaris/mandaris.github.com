<p>With the release of Mohave, I no longer have a desktop computer that can run the latest version of the operating system. Part of me is sad because of the feeling of missing out and that I'm unable to afford a new computer.</p>
<p>Another part of me is relieved in the knowledge that I don't have to worry about my current software not being able to run, having to wait for 3rd to bring support the OS, or further fractioning of what I can and (increasingly) can not do.</p>

</figure>
<p>The more that I dive into the quest of having my own spot on the internet, the more that I find that I have things that I want to do with it. Which means more research, experiments and late nights. </p>
<p>Currently, I'm on a mission to get webmentions and pingback working on my site. It's been pretty slow going because I want to incorporate it into my current blogging workflow. A workflow that is currently not flowing at all<sup id="fnref-flow"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-flow">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought I'd focus on making some changes so that I can make it fit better with all the new stuff that is coming out for the <a href="https://indieweb.org" title="The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the &quot;corporate web&quot;.">indieweb</a>.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-sign-in">Setting up sign in</h3>
<p>The first thing to do is make some changes to my template to allow for sign up according to the <a href="https://indieweb.org/How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain" title="How to setup web sign-in on your own domain.">web directions</a></p>
<p>I thought the easiest ways of doing this was to use github<sup id="fnref-github"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-github">2</a></sup> or twitter<sup id="fnref-twitter"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-twitter">3</a></sup>. I pushed the github login near the top of the page so that it would look for it first.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">GITHUB_USERNAME</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;!-- IndieWeb sign-in --&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;link rel=&quot;me&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">GITHUB_USERNAME</span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot; /&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endif</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>I then included the twitter login information with the rest of the twitter information.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">TWITTER_USERNAME</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;!-- Twitter Specific Info --&gt;</span>

</span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endif</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div>


<h3 id="setting-up-webmentions">Setting up webmentions</h3>
<p>After the login was set up, I added this to enable webmentions that are specific to any website that uses the template.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">WEBMENTIONS</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;!-- Enabling webmention functionality --&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;link rel=&quot;pingback&quot; href=&quot;https://webmention.io/</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">WEBMENTIONS</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">/xmlrpc&quot; /&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;link rel=&quot;webmention&quot; href=&quot;https://webmention.io/</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">WEBMENTIONS</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">/webmention&quot; /&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endif</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>Unfortunately, I still need to test it and get it in front of other people to use. I'm going to lay the foundation down and do some research so that I can get ping backs to work properly.</p>
<h3 id="more-meta-data">More meta data</h3>
<p>From my reading of indieweb.org, I see that it doesn't use the <a href="https://mandarismoore.com/2018/06/blog-accomplishments.html" title="The Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph.">OpenGraph</a> and <a href="https://schema.org" title="Schema.org is a set of extensible schemas that enables webmasters to embed structured data on their web pages for use by search engines and other applications.">Schema.org</a> that I <a href="https://mandarismoore.com/2018/06/blog-accomplishments.html" title="My accomplishments on this blog">put in</a> the theme. </p>
<p>I'm hesitant to add these new tags because it lowers the validation scores, but I hope that it will help with accessibility and just make the site work better for those who want to find it.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I've got a lot of things on my mind and places where I can make the site move forward. I hope that those who read this feel inspired and have some input on how to make the template better. </p>
<p>If so, the theme can be found <a href="https://github.com/mandaris/modest" title="A very simple template for pelican">here</a>.</p>

<p>I joined mastodon.cloud last night because of all the drama with Twitter the in the last couple of years. I haven't been personally attacked by bots or nazi, but I don't believe that I should have to worry about something like that.</p>
<p>Although, I'm hesitant to join <em>yet another</em> social media platform when I can barely keep up with the ones that I'm in now (facebook, micro.blog, slack, and reddit), I thought it would be ok to at the very least reserve my name in case I do decide to use it.</p>

<p>Recently, there was a post in the mac power users <a href="https://talk.macpowerusers.com/" title="Mac Power Users Discourse Forums.">forums</a> about how <a href="https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/twitter-is-broken/6745/17" title="Twitter is broken">twitter was broken</a> with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, with the recent changes by Twitter and their impacts, does anyone think there’s a real alternative that power users will embrace? If it’s an opportunity to move to something, then who is creating the option that will take us into the next decade of microblogging?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I made a mistake of replying to a sub posting that had the following and not the main post by a user named dotty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t have an answer for you, but I will chime in. I live in Colorado and have come to rely on Twitter for fire and evacuation updates. It is by far the fastest way to get emergency updates. I have an “emergency” group that shows push notifications. All other notifications are turned off if they’re not in that group. Now that push notifications are not allowed on either Tweetbot or Twitterrific, is there another alternative?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I admit I was a little too flippant with my response. Two anxious to really think about my response before posting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that this might be a good thing. Although we won’t get push notifications, the applications will still work.</p>
<p>If anything, this might help those who might have become to the constant notifications.</p>
<p>/Devil’s Advocate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a missed opportunity and got a response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@mandaris , I explained I only used Twitter notifications for emergency notifications about fire and evacuations. I don’t understand how this is a “good thing” for me not to receive this information as quickly as possible. Am I misunderstanding your post? I know you signed it “devil’s advocate,” but seriously??? I sincerely doubt Twitter was trying to do us a favor by restricting their API — It sounds like it was a money decision.</p>
<p>I agree that some are much too attached to their phone and notifications going off every few minutes can be distracting, but that really isn’t the point of this post. There are legitimate reasons someone would want timely push notifications. There was an armed escaped convict in my neighborhood recently and the sheriffs dept put out a twitter notification to stay indoors until the person was apprehended… and then another notification giving the “all clear.” How is it a “good thing” not to receive these types of alerts if you choose to? After, I received a call from my neighbor to check in on me because there was a “reverse 911” that went to her land line and she was concerned I wouldn’t know because I don’t have a land line.</p>
<p>The point of my post is to figure out an alternative now that Twitter has made this decision, not to weigh the merits of notifications from Twitter. After a summer from hell with wildfires raging all around me, these notifications were a blessing. If there were no notifications, all was well, but if my home, or the home of loved ones needed evacuated from fire (or now flash flood) it was a “good thing” indeed to be alerted ASAP. It literally saved lives.</p>
<p>All I want to know now is if I can set up something similar or if I can still receive these notifications another way. If I can still get them and they will be delayed 1-2 minutes that is fine. I only want the notification if it is truly from my emergency list on twitter, and I can’t find a setting for this anywhere with Twitter’s own app. Am I missing something?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very thoughtful, I took the time to write a small response that I hope doesn't erupt into a huge flame war and to appease anyone else who might come across it at a later date.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, I’m happy that the twitter service has helped you and those you care about. Those are all very good use cases and we can all see why Jack Dorsey would state that twitter would drive to be a <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/7/27/17621090/twitter-health-user-growth-q2-earnings-2018-jack-dorsey">daily utility</a>.</p>
<p>But that is the thing, something like that should be a utility that our phones should be able to tap into. For example, I live in California and we have something called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMBER_Alert">Amber Alert</a>. You get alerts without the need for an account. You can get alerts on your phone, billboards and radio.</p>
<p>As a society, we should be making sure that services such as this are expanded to handle use cases as you have described them.</p>
<p>Now, as far as the question of how to use the twitter app to get you what you want. I don’t know if they have a “vip” notification group on the roadmap. I would hope that they discover it needs to be there since they wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re committed to understanding why people hire 3rd party clients over our own apps.</p>

<p>Probably not my greatest moment on the internet but I'm hoping that I communicated my thoughts well. And just in case, I had sent a private message stating that and Doty responded that</p>

<p>Well, I purchased the update for <a href="https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm">ScreeFlow 8</a> based off of my fear of missing out on new features and the dream that I'll one day make something with it. </p>
<p>I'm trying to change my habits with my computer and thought that I would focus on making things instead.</p>
<p>So, here is the first video that I've made in a very long time. I hope that they get better with practice.</p>

<p>The drawback is that I'd have to leave my relatively secure position working for the state. I spent the rest of the dream worrying about how I should approach the subject and cleaning up my local neighborhood.</p>

</figure>
<p>I'm about to do a review of what needs to be done this week and I'm hesitant to start. Although I've been getting better at making sure that things get done, the sheer amount of "stuff" can feel overwhelming if I look at all of it at once. </p>
<p>I think that is why I find myself drawn to OmniFocus and GTD in general. It give me a tool that allows me to trust that what I'm <em>not</em> doing is correct.</p>
<p>But back to the matter at hand, what should my next project be?</p>
<h3 id="moving-the-site-generation-to-another-server">Moving the site generation to another server</h3>
<p>Currently, I have a iMac at home that generates the site and then <code>scp</code> the files to a server. The only times that I have had an issue is when I had to shut down dropbox running on the machine because it was being a resource hog.</p>
<p>My plan is to move all of my posts to a repository and then having a cron job running on the server to do an update every hour to update the repository and then the website. </p>

<p>Previously, I had written about how I found a solution to my compulsion to make sure that the headers on my blog were on the write<sup id="fnref-write"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-write">2</a></sup> level <a href="getting-mdx_downheader-to-work.html" title="Getting MDX_Downheader to work">here</a>.</p>
<p>As with so many other things in life, there was an easier<sup id="fnref-easy"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-easy">1</a></sup> solution that was built into python-markdown.</p>
<p>When I had first explored this issue, I had looked at the <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/header_id/" title="Automatically generates id attributes.">HeaderID</a> it was marked as being deprecated and to be used for adding anchors for headings. I didn't read the whole thing because it didn't seem it would fit my needs. I continued on and found my current solution.</p>
<p><em>But</em>, the thought that there could be a better way kept on nagging me even though I was happy<sup id="fnref-happy"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-happy">3</a></sup> with how my site turned out.</p>
<p>As I was in the process of updating my <a href="https://github.com/mandaris/pelican-test-content" title="Simple pelican articles to test new themes.">Pelican Test Content</a>, I went back to the <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/" title="A compilation of various Python-Markdown extensions">python-markdown extensions page</a> to make sure that I had covered most of the use cases. I noticed that it had a <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/toc/">Table of Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="all-about-that-base">All about that base</h3>
<p>The first thing that I found was that the extension allows me to set the <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/toc/#usage">base for headers</a> fairly easily by setting a property in my <code>pelicanconfig.py</code>. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Markdown options</span>
<span class="n">MARKDOWN</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;extension_configs&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This eliminates the need for the additional plugin and as an added bonus allows me to have a table of contents for those really long posts that I never write.</p>
<h3 id="table-of-pain">Table of Pain</h3>
<p><img alt="The html that is generated is hard to read." src="images/table-of-pain.png">
There are only a couple mild things that I don't really enjoy about this new solution. </p>
<h4 id="div-ided-we-stand-on-syntax">Div-ided we stand on syntax</h4>
<ul>
<li>I'd love if this wasn't in a <code>div</code> and used either a <code>nav</code> or <code>aside</code> tag for accessibility and my own personal comfort. </li>
<li>Also, the number of <code>li</code> and <code>ul</code> tags can be hard to read if you want to read the raw html.</li>
<li>Titles for table of contents is in a <code>span</code> tag. I find that kind of ironic. </li>
</ul>
<p>Seriously, just nitpicky at this point.</p>
<h4 id="making-it-look-nice">Making it look nice</h4>
<p>This part is just me going back to trying to figure out how to make it look nice in the browser. I imagine that it won't take long, but there are going to be a couple of ugly iterations.</p>

<p>I'm in the bedroom upstairs. It's kind of like an office because it has a desk and no one to bother me at the moment. It gives me a second to think about what I'm going to do next in life. </p>
<p>I usually take some time to go through my list of projects in OmniFocus or read through my emails. Throughout the years, I find myself using the default mail client that comes with macOS.</p>
<p>I think that it is because the first time that I really enjoyed working with email was in college which is when I started using macOS.</p>
<p>Of course, I have a couple posts about how I used <a href="/2010/01/how_i_use_email.html" title="An old post">web clients</a> but I find that I use my laptop when I really want to clean up what's in my inbox.</p>
