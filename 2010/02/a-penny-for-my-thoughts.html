    <p>I'm trying to think of all the positive things that are happening in my life. Sometimes I lose track of those things that I should be grateful for so I want to list them here:</p>
<ul>
<li>My wife.<br>
  There are no perfect people in this world, but when push comes to shove I feel that she has m back.</li>
<li>My children.<br>
It's a kind of pride and warm feeling to see them grow from little meatballs into little girls. I'm not looking forward to have them leave one day. </li>
<li>My job.
It's been able to support our house hold at a standard of living that's becoming harder and harder to maintain in this economy.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-economic-rock-on-which-we-stand">The economic rock on which we stand</h4>
<p>Speaking of economy, I've been thinking about how even though we are in a recession, there seems to be more and more ads on things. Once again, I'm not a communist, but it seems crazy that our society has no problems having all these messages about buying things when most Americans are having problems balancing thier budgets. </p>
<p>Caeer builder recently had a survey stating that 42 percent of their <a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?id=pr651&amp;sd=8/11/2011&amp;ed=8/11/2099">respondents</a> were living paycheck to paycheck. I think it is more of a personal thing rather than the amount of money that people make. From a very young age we are taught to keep up with "the Jones'" and the other thing that we are taught about money is the single semester of econ<sup id="fnref-econ_class"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-econ_class">1</a></sup> in high school. Personally, I think that it's a little late because by then all your classmates have already been bombarded by barbie, GI Joe and Disney and I doubt many of them have an idea of what it is costing to live like they live.</p>

<p>My econ teacher was pretty well off. Her husband made a lot of money and this was her way of giving back to society. There were many rumors about her drinking in her car between classes.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-econ_class" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
