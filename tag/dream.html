</header><p>I was in a dark place. It was a cage with other people and a couple lights above us. </p>
<p>I could hear people walking across and i knew who they were.</p>
<p>They were being judged and they were going to heaven.</p>
<hr />
<p>and then a man came down dressed in black and drinking a cup of coffee. he asked "why should you live?" as he sipped his drink and sat down.</p>
<p>"how can i find my pashion," i yelled.</p>
<p>he almost spat out his coffee... </p>
<p>he readjusted himself in the chair and repeated the question as if i hadnt said anyhting.</p>
<p>i felt like i was doomed and helpless. that nothing i said or did would change anything...</p>
<p>i feeling that im too familiar with...</p>
<p>and then the alarm went off.</p>

</header><p>Today, I woke up from a nightmare. I dreamed that I was unable to move forward with my life. That there was some list out there that kept track of my every mistake and that it prevented me from getting a raise at my current job or to move to another job. There was a guy who let me look at the list and it was filled with minute and cryptic offenses. The whole time I stood there shocked because there wasn't a way to defend myself... it was all on the paper that I wasn't supposed to see in the first place. What do I do? How can this be fair? Some of the things were so small as to seems inconsequential. Some of them had nothing to do with who I was, what I had done in the past or how I had changed over the years.</p>
<p>Waking up, I realized that I was looking at the fear I've of just letting my past mistakes dictate who I am and denying myself of the possibility of being better.</p>
