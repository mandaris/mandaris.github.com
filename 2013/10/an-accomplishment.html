    <p>I've had a little idea going on in the back of my head for the last couple of months about a simple application that would pop up after a given keyboard shortcut. It's a simple idea and never got around to doing it because I didn't sit down and do it. Even on the days, where I thought "Hey,If I had an easy way to keep track of all the good things that I've done, I'd feel better about myself". Normally, I just look at the todo item that I had in OmniFocus and just push it back a couple days or weeks because of priorities.</p>
<p>But today, I sat down and decided that if I wanted to really follow my own words about controlling my life I've got to make good on the commitments that I make to myself big or small. </p>
<p>So I sat down behind my laptop opened up my AppleScript 1-2-3<sup id="fnref-unused"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-unused">1</a></sup> and started searching the internet after not seeing a solution to my problems on the first page.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">theSumm</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="na">text returned</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">display dialog</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Latest Accomplishment&quot;</span> <span class="nb">buttons</span> <span class="s2">&quot;OK&quot;</span> <span class="nv">default</span> <span class="nv">answer</span> <span class="s2">&quot;A step forward&quot;</span> <span class="nv">default</span> <span class="nb">button</span> <span class="s2">&quot;OK&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">tell</span> <span class="nb">application</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Calendar&quot;</span>
    <span class="nb">make</span> <span class="nv">todo</span> <span class="nb">at</span> <span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nv">todos</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nv">calendar</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Accomplishments&quot;</span> <span class="nv">with</span> <span class="na">properties</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nv">summary</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nv">theSumm</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">completion</span> <span class="nv">date</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">current date</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">tell</span>
</pre></div>


<p>At first, I was just going to put this in a script file and then run it from a service, but I decided that the easiest way of doing this was to use <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/" title="An app that I've been using more and more to get things moving quickly.">Keyboard Maestro</a>. It was really cool that I got to move the entire script into the application so I didn't have to move between the different applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mandaris/10540756656/" title="A screenshot of my first keyboard maestro attempt to make a short cut to log my accomplishments"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3783/10540756656_0d7bd92af3.jpg" width="427" height="500" alt="A copy of my first keyboard maestro attempt to make a short cut to log my accomplishments"></a></p>
<p>This is what I had originally envisioned, but I started to think about the limitations of keeping all of this in reminders. All the applications that use the system built <a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/apps/#reminders" title="The default todo application on Mac OSX">task management tools</a> have a focus on what needs to be done and if I want to have way to look at this stuff quickly and I wasn't sure how to look at accomplishments that were marked as completed a month ago.</p>
<p>I took a look at what I was doing on a daily basis and saw that I've been doing more and more journaling using <a href="http://dayoneapp.com" title="Day One is a great simple application that allows you to have a journal that syncs with all my devices">Day One</a><sup id="fnref-dayoneshortcut"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-dayoneshortcut">2</a></sup>. </p>
<p>I didn't want to make the Day One application open up every time that I finished something new so I looked at the <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/tools/cli-man/" title="Day One command line interface">command line interface</a> and came up with this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mandaris/10543020504/" title="Screenshot of my keyboard maestro macro to log accomplishments quickly using the command line interface for Day One"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5487/10543020504_5edfa7b7ba.jpg" width="387" height="500" alt="Screenshot of my keyboard maestro macro to log accomplishments quickly using the command line interface for Day One"></a></p>
<p>So far, the only downside is that I have to go into Day One to make all the hashtags turn into tags and I have to do a search for that tag if I want to see all my accomplishments in a given time.</p>
<p>I think for the next iteration, I might set up <a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/" title="GeekTool: A tool to show information from files and commands on the desktop">GeekTool</a> to show my latest accomplishment on my desktop, but I'm just happy that I finished this initial task.</p>

<p>I bought this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Training-AppleScript-1-2-3-ebook/dp/B000SEI7EO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1381753150&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=applescript+1-2-3">book</a> almost a year ago so that I could start teaching myself to do more automation on my computer. Turns out, I just needed to take the time and focus on something that I really wanted to create. It felt good and I think I'll actually get through it... when I get the time.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-unused" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I'd already had a specific keyboard shortcut for opening up the menubar pop up for quick writing of thoughts and feelings, but I didn't want to add a <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html" title="Textexpander is a tool that I use when I'm writing things over and over again.">textexpander</a> snippet to add an accomplishment tag.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-dayoneshortcut" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
