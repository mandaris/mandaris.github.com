</figure>
<p>I'm about to do a review of what needs to be done this week and I'm hesitant to start. Although I've been getting better at making sure that things get done, the sheer amount of "stuff" can feel overwhelming if I look at all of it at once. </p>
<p>I think that is why I find myself drawn to OmniFocus and GTD in general. It give me a tool that allows me to trust that what I'm <em>not</em> doing is correct.</p>
<p>But back to the matter at hand, what should my next project be?</p>
<h3 id="moving-the-site-generation-to-another-server">Moving the site generation to another server</h3>
<p>Currently, I have a iMac at home that generates the site and then <code>scp</code> the files to a server. The only times that I have had an issue is when I had to shut down dropbox running on the machine because it was being a resource hog.</p>
<p>My plan is to move all of my posts to a repository and then having a cron job running on the server to do an update every hour to update the repository and then the website. </p>

<p>Today, I thought about how I start most of my post with the word "today". If you look through all of my writings on this blog you probably won't find it because it's usually the first thing that I delete when I'm editing.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because some part of me is always thinking about how I want to start or continue something and that <em>Today</em> will be the day that everything will work out and I can start down easy street.</p>
<p>It hasn't happened but I feel that life is filled with stops and starts and as long as you focus on making some progress everyday - even if it's a little - that feeling of <em>Today</em> goes away.</p>

<figure><img alt="Mindmap of what is on my mind." src="images/what-is-up.png"><figcaption>Mindmap of what is on my mind.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I just spent 5 minutes on what are some of the things that are currently on my mind. Honestly, I think I spent more time on the clip art associated with the mindmap than actually thinking about what it means. </p>
<p>I've got a lot of things happening right now and I hoped that putting it in a pretty picture can help me sort it out. So...</p>
<h3 id="whats-up">What’s Up</h3>
<p>Ultimately, I exported the mind map as an outline and decided to  expand it here.</p>
<h4 id="work">Work</h4>
<p>The way that I currently make a living. I find that I'm grinding for someone else and not me or my family.</p>
<h5 id="doing-the-work">Doing the work</h5>
<p>I don't feel that I have a huge problem doing what is asked of me. I <em>do</em> have a problem with the amount of things that need to be done and the amount of support that I'm getting from everyone else. I feel as though a lot of people don't understand that things need to be balanced.</p>
<h5 id="dealing-with-the-people">Dealing with the People</h5>
<p>I do not feel that the people that I'm working with are on the same page. Sometimes, I feel like I'm all by myself on a lot of fronts. I have friends at work, but I also have people who are more into their own ego than getting to the next level in life.</p>
<p>Definitely room for more teamwork. </p>
<h4 id="making-ends-meet">Making ends meet</h4>
<p>Money is absolutely horrible. They say it cannot make you happy, but I find that not having it certainly can make you unhappy.</p>
<h5 id="cutting-expenses">Cutting expenses</h5>
<p>No question. Have to cut back on soo many things. I've started taking my lunch and I've long since stopped buying comic books. The problem is that me and my family like to go out to eat quite a bit.</p>
<h5 id="making-more">Making More</h5>
<p>I've been playing around with the idea of getting a second job. It would have to be a night position, but I don't know if I'd be able to pull it off with the lack of sleep that would eventually happen.</p>
<h4 id="being-fulfilled">Being fulfilled</h4>
<p>This one is just about how I feel about myself. I feel as if I lost my direction in life and I'm really questioning if I had one at all. </p>
<h5 id="what-is-my-current-passion">What is my current passion?</h5>
<p>I like messing around with MacOS X. I love the feel of typing and the pleasure of getting things like my website up and running.</p>
<p>But I want to make something else too.</p>
<p>Not just this blog post but something that can help others, like a tutorial or book.</p>
<h5 id="where-do-i-see-myself-in-the-future">Where do I see myself in the future?</h5>
<p>Unfortunately, the future looks grim. I've got upcoming expenses and less time and resources to deal with them.</p>
<h4 id="having-a-family">Having a family</h4>
<p>The most important aspect. I have a responsibility not just to myself but to other people.</p>
<h5 id="being-able-to-communicate">Being able to communicate</h5>
<p>I want to make sure that my family is able to talk to me if they need to and that I work on my active listening.</p>
<h5 id="making-sure-that-everyone-is-cared-for">Making sure that everyone is cared for</h5>
<p>I love my family and it is important to me that they are happy.</p>
<h3 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h3>
<p>What a small little rant. I feel much better getting that out of my system and will have to review this moving forward.</p>

<p>Today, I've decided that I was going to push my website out to the masses before the end of the week. This is a personal blog and just because it isn't <em>perfect</em> it is something that I created and I want to take pride in the fact that I'm willing to get out there and work on something and make it better.</p>
<p>Some of the things that I'd like to work on will be the handling of navigation at the top and figuring out how to get the tufte style to work properly with pelican. I attempted to get everything working with a liquid tag but the parser doesn't work well with blocklevel tags and wraps it in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> so the expected css doesn't apply properly. This only applies to fullwidth figures but I'd like it all to be uniform.</p>

<p>I like the idea of being a writer. i also like the idea of being a programmer. I spend a lot of time reading about what this and that person did an invariably putthem on a little bit of a pedistal. After that I stand back and say "that person is cool. I wonder if I could do something cool like that. I know, I'll takesome notes and then when I get a chance I'll make something must as cool."</p>
<p>Nothing comes from just wanting and -at this point- my dreams are only hurting me because I see these people and only see what i lack versus what i can bring to the table.</p>
<p>I feel like im hurting and i dont know if I'll ever  heal. </p>
<p>I tell myself it ok. That I can get up and do something more with my life but it feels like all my breaks are simply to break even. </p>
<p>I need help.</p>
<p>I need some kind of guidence.</p>

<p>A while ago I came across some questions to consider everytime that I do a review of my tasks. The problem is that I've attached the questions to a task in OmniFocus and -honestly- I don't think it's helpful to do something like that unless I think and write about it. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is this system trustworthy? If not, why not? Do I need to make better backups?<br>
No, there are two major problems with the personal productivity. The first is that I don't schedule enough time for something. How can I finish a task when I don't make any time for it. Secondly, I don't do enough positive reviews. I need to do a review every day to make sure that tasks don't fall through the cracks and I don't overwhelm myself. I find most of my reviews are when I'm under the gun. Not a good thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a next actionable task? Can it actually be readily done?<br>
Yes... for the most part. I have a couple projects that have items like "Brainstorm next action".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When do I anticipate looking at this next action’s context?<br>
This goes back to the first question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What will this project look like when it is done?
Depends on the project, baby.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When do I think I’ll need to see this project again?<br>
That also depends on the project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
