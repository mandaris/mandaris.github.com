    <p>Well, there has been a lot of activity in my sphere of influence related to the newest release of Fantatical for macOS and iOS. I've been using fantastical on my phone since version 2 came out and I had almost purchased the macOS version as well but stopped because I only had so much money in my tech budget at the time<sup id="fnref:time"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:time">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>It's very well designed and offered the best text input that I've seen. I'm lucky to be part of a very busy family where we have several activities almost everyday. I <em>thought</em> I would be doing more of the information entry, but I find that my wife has been on top of it most times<sup id="fnref:wife"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wife">2</a></sup>. She never got why I'd like to use a third party app.</p>
<p>In fact, I was talking to her about the new version of the app and she said she was bored with the topic right after I told her about the $50 a year price tag.</p>
<p>But is it sticker shock that has everyone riled up on this subject? I thought I'd take a moment to write about all of my feelings and thoughts on the matter.</p>
<h3 id="subscription">Subscription</h3>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that flexibits is moving from a paid app to a subscription model. </p>
<p>I don't <em>hate</em> subscriptions.</p>
<p>In fact, I've even got a couple. </p>
<p>It feels like a lot of developers are doing this in order to switch from getting a huge amount of money when an application releases and seeing it slowly dwindle awa until the next version. Ask anyone who has a family or likes to eat on a regular basis if they would like to have a steady income versus hoping that they have enough from one month to the next, and I'm sure you'll get more votes for the former.</p>
<p>The problem is that for some people this is <em>Another</em> subscription. If you are the kind of person who at one point bought fantastical 2 - which wasn't the only calendar app at the time of the release or since - I would guess that you may also be someone who has purchased other apps or services. It is very easy to sign up for something and forget that it's even there or that there are other options. In fact, it's the main reason that AOL is still in business.</p>
<p>Individually, these apps and services aren't expensive, but they can very quickly add up. You can see this midigated sometimes by companies offering a discount if you purchase the whole year instead of month to month<sup id="fnref:disney"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:disney">3</a></sup>, but both parties usualy benefit from this.</p>
<p>As a resposible adult, it's up to you to take control of your financials and determine if the one or many subscripts truly bring value to your life.</p>
<h3 id="transition">Transition</h3>
<p>This was a rough transition.</p>
<p>As a long term user, I was excited about a new release and really wanted to see what the team at flexibits was going to roll out. I normally have auto updates turned off and like to read the release notes when I get home. With this release, I updated as soon as I found out that the release was available.</p>
<p>Downloaded the app.</p>
<p>Tapped on it.</p>
<p>An immediately see a page to create an flexibits account.</p>
