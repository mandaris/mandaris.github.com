</header><p>Recently, <a href="http://quotidianquest.com/2016/04/my-thoughts-on-text-expander.html">I posted about my thoughts on Text Expander</a> after they announced that they were going to be moving to a subscription. And I got some feedback regarding what I wrote. I've pasted it below because I honestly don't get any feed back regarding any of my writing<label for="feedback" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="feedback" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Most likely because I do not have comments on the site</span>. </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>I completely agree that they have kind of boxed themselves out of the "casual user" market and are now more focused on "power users" or those that are using this tool on multiple devices (like me)</li>
<li>I think your point is very well written, but would love to see more information about the alternative (AutoHotKey) that you have selected. </li>
<li>Perhaps it would be helpful to mention a couple of things (If any) that could make textexpander that tool for you again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Great job though. You can definitely tell that you care about the company.</p>
<p>It's just they don't fit in your system anymore (which happens)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like feedback. At this point, good or bad I'm happy with the fact that someone else is reading and it gives me some motivation to make the writing better. In this case, I'd like to further expand on the last two points in the reverse order.</p>
<h1>3. How to make the tool more helpful for me</h1>
<p>This is actually a something that needs to happen on my end<label for="disservice" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="disservice" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">To be fair, the application tries its best to help me be as productive as possible.</span>.  The people at smile give you a number of examples that you can use right away to save you time.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>When I was making this post, I added one more. If anything knowing that I might have to give the application up has sparked new interest in using it. Plus all the the writing that I've been doing.</figcaption><img src="../../images/my_textexpander_setup_2016-04.png"/></figure></p>
<p>The application does help in one major way everyday (when I do use it). Most mornings, I do use it to create my grateful journal template<sup id="fnref:affirmation"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:affirmation" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.  Here is a brief example of the template that I use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre># Things I&#39;m Grateful for #
+ 

# Things I&#39;m Excited about #
+ 

# One Thing I&#39;d like to focus on #
</pre></div>


<p>By default, the application will monitor what you type and suggest even more snippets that you can add to your collection.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>I was kind of shocked by some of the things that I write multiple times and it has the possibility of helping me change some habits.</figcaption><img src="../../images/my_textexpander_suggestions.png"/></figure></p>
<p>Maybe, I shouldn't have freaked out when I saw this feature pop up and you can always change the way it works in the preference because it could have been helpful. But it seemed creepy and annoying. </p>
<p><figure><figcaption>Part of me was getting annoyed with all the notifications on what I could use as a snippet.</figcaption><img src="../../images/my_textexpander_preferences_2016-04.png"/></figure></p>
<p>If you're feeling adventurous you can even go to the website of one of my heroes <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a> and check out his page of <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/te-tools/">text expander tools</a>. </p>
<p>Despite all this, I still find that I wasn't using it to the fullest<label for="text_expander_usage" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="text_expander_usage" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="../../images/my_textexpander_usage.png" alt="This was my last usage stat. Take it with a *HUGE* grain of salt because I only have it on my laptop and I do frequent re-installs"/><br/>This was my last usage stat. Take it with a <em>HUGE</em> grain of salt because I only have it on my laptop and I do frequent re-installs</span>. Ultimately, we all have to balance what we want versus what we need the money to go to.</p>
<h1>2. AutoHotKey</h1>
<p>On this topic, I don't have much to say because I no longer have a windows machine to use on a day to day basis. The great thing about this tool was that I was using it to now only fire off extensions but to launch applications and replicate user interactions for testing.</p>
<p>I would often use a keyboard short cut to launch the vnc client because the laptop that was given to employees to use might not be that powerful or we wanted to run a test on another machine that had a faster connection. </p>
<p>For user interactions, I created a script that would type in the keyboard shortcut that would make windows rotate the screen or do a series of mouse clicks to reproduce... something...</p>
<h1>1. Updated...</h1>
<p>While I was writing this, Smile reduced the price to $20 a year for the software. Which changes the deal significantly. Now I have to think about what the software is going to do for me going forward. Is this going to save me time in the future? Will I save more time than the time that I used writing about it here? </p>
<p>I don't know.</p>

</header><p><a href="https://textexpander.com">TextExpander</a> is a tool that I forget that I have. Actually, TextExpander is a tool that I forget to use. In the last couple of years, I've moved to a workflow that really isn't working for me day to day. I have a laptop, an imac, a couple ipads and all the work computers<sup id="fnref:windows"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:windows" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that have been supplied for me to use in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>Recently, the people at Smile software have switch the software to be a subscription model. On one hand, I understand that some companies need to do this to keep their businesses afloat; the monthly revenue is better to budget against versus someone purchasing the software every major release (maybe). On the other hand, this means that as a user I don't "own" the software; I'm leasing<label for="leasing" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="leasing" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">It seems to be the trend nowadays that people pay a fee to use things from homes(rent), cars and music. I do not have a problem with it, but it seems like a lot of money is going to things that we will not be able to get some equity back from.</span> it.</p>
<p>Honestly, I can see why they would do something like that. The company specializes in tools like this and pdfpen and I like the fact that they sponsor a lot of podcasts that I listen to. I wish them well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be joining them on this experiment. I'm not a power user of the software. Because of the way that I've been living my technical life, I haven't seen myself repeating a lot of text. You can probably see the result of this in the fact that I don't post that often. The header for this posting is stored as a text expander snippet but I find myself having to look it up in order to use it.</p>
<p>I wish them luck and I'm happy to use my current version until it stops working.</p>

</header><p>Honestly, a lot of people that I respect are talking about it. I think I'm going to have to step through the tutorial again. But honestly, I'd like to think about what I want to do with it. </p>
<p>I already have a couple text editors but I love messing around with the tools more than doing the job sometimes. </p>
<p>The only reason that I don't use sublime text is because of the price. The "free" demo allows you to use it as long as you want but you see a pop up reminding you that it hasn't been purchased yet. I'm not at a point where I can justify the price and being someone who works in the industry, I want to encourage people to pay for software.</p>
<p>I've talked to some other people and it seems like they are proud of the being able to mentally blockout the popup and dismiss it without missing a beat.</p>
<p>To me, that just seems wrong on so many levels.</p>

 #<a href="http://quotidianquest.com/tag/osx.html">OSX</a></span></p>
</header><p>At today's <a href="http://www.macnexus.org/">macnexus</a> meeting we had <a href="http://tedlandau.com/">Ted Landau</a> come speak about the IOS-ification of Mac OS X and I found it to be rather enjoyable. I agreed with a lot of his points about how certain changes to the OS could be a good thing that it would help all the new recruits<sup id="fnref:recruits"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:recruits" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> get used to the operating system.</p>
<p>The problem for me is that it hasn't been easy for me. Some of the things that I've grown accustomed to were changed in Lion and it took a while to get used<sup id="fnref:annoy"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:annoy" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> to them or find the best way to work around them. I've since grown used to the dip in performance as certain animations have played out and I even enjoy the way some Mail.app works (to a degree).</p>
<p>My problem is that I still feel that certain things aren't being taken care of properly. I've created a little list of some of my continuing gripes with Lion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/mission-control.html">Mission Control</a> doesn't fully replace Spaces<br />
I understand that Mission Control is supposed to be more accessible for users and -honestly- I turned Spaces on and off sometimes when I was attempting different workflows, but it seems that takes more work in order to use it. With Spaces, you could assign different application to different desktops, but if you want that in Lion, you have to put the applications into the different spaces by yourself and hopefully you don't need to restart or anything. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What's the deal with FrontRow?<br />
If I had a dollar for every time that someone told me to use <a href="http://www.plexapp.com/">Plex</a> instead, I'd have at least enough money to get a value meal. If I had a dollar for every person who used the feature minus the guy who tells me to use Plex, at best I'd break even.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Address book<br />
I doubt who ever OK'd didn't already have all or most of his contacts already sorted. Navigating between different groups and then putting people into the right place is painful and the interface is ugly. Yes, I've looked at <a href="http://www.cobookapp.com/">cobooks.app</a> and I think it's trying too hard to look nice for something I plan on just updating and closing 95% of the time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting to the point</h2>
<p>Ok, so after going over some of the same problems that I was having with Lion. We had a Q&amp;A session where he said that despite all of these issues he's looking forward to <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/">Mountain Lion</a>.</p>
<p>I was actually a little suprised by this, but he said it with such sincerity that it actually hit me like a mini <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">reality distortion field</a>. </p>
<p>I was at peace.</p>
<p>Things are going to get better.</p>
<p>And then the wave was over and I felt like a storm trooper that just let an old man and a kid scoot on by with the droids that I was looking for.</p>
