<p>A long time ago, I went to a seminar called EmpowerU. Don't bother looking them up because the name has been used by so many different organizations, it would just confuse you to what I'm trying to say...</p>
<p><em>Anyway,</em> I went to a seminar and I really got inspired to make a change in my life and I've been struggling with trying to make sense of where I want to go next.</p>
<p>It feels like all I can think about it just trying to make it to the next week or day. </p>
<p>But that's not thriving, and that's not the example that I want to show my children.</p>
<p>How do I get out of this rut?</p>

<p>Sometimes, getting ready for bed is the hardest thing to do. In my home, nights are the time that we actually get a chance to sit down and do the things we need to do such as pay bills and schedule activities.</p>
<p>My wife has been the one taking care of the bills in recent months. On one hand, it's good because I found myself having trouble keeping track of when and where money was going. The stress and guilt of missing a bill just got worse and worse over the years as expenses continued to grow.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this has caused problems as I feel pushed out of key decision making areas. </p>
<p>We've never been explicit about it but there have been under tones of hostility about money.</p>
<p>I do what I can, I follow the budget that we agree on and be understanding when she's stressed out. After all, I was doing it for years before we switched.</p>
<p>We're in better shape as far as budgetting, but I tread every night we have to go over bills.</p>

<p>I wanted to spend sometime looking at some resources that I came across that I'm going to use to make my site work better with the micro.blog format.</p>
<h4 id="implementing-microblogging-in-pelican">Implementing microblogging in pelican</h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://ascraeus.org/implementing-microblogging-in-pelican/">Link</a></strong></p>
<p>This one was pretty interesting in that it was the first link in my search and let me know that it was indeed possible. Unfortunately, the site has moved from <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">pelican</a> to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> and I couldn't find the theme in the users github repository (unless he's renamed it).</p>
<h4 id="microblogging-with-pelican">Microblogging with pelican</h4>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.bellebcooper.com/microblogging-with-pelican.html">Link</a></strong> 
This link seems a little more promising as the writer is still actively using pelican to generate her site. Not only that but she has a couple example iOS workflows that give me ideas on how to quickly generate posts for the site. </p>
<p>Currently, I don't have any bandwidth to do any of these options in the next couple of days, but I hope that by writing about them here someone else can use them to make their site better.</p>

<p><img alt="Example of markdown syntax meant to test new themes." src="images/pelican-test-content.png"></p>
<p>When I'm trying to come up with a new theme for my blog, I like to think about the different scenerios of what I can put together. I admit that a lot of what I design is rarely shown in my daily writing, but I like the possibilities of expressing myself in this way and part of me hopes that someone else will see my theme and use it or make it better.</p>
<p>In light of this, I don't like using my own content sometimes because I don't always have something recent to test with a theme with.</p>
<p>That's why I took some time and created a repo just for this purpose. I present:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mandaris/pelican-test-content">Pelican Test Content!</a></p>
<p>It's a couple of articles and pages that I use to simulate a website in pelican. It looks like most of the <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes">theme designers</a> create their own set of test data but I'm hoping that this can be the seed or at least add on to whatever else is available. </p>

<p>I like Byword for writing. It has a very simple interface that I've come to associate with writing. When I want to just sit down and let my fingers put the words in, I find myself drawn to this application. </p>
<p>I've tried others but I feel my brain is now weird to think that writing = byword.</p>
<p>The only problem is when I'm out and about and I just have my phone. I don't really have a comfortable way for me to put something like this blog post together without my laptop. I'll have to come up with something.</p>

<h3 id="children-in-westworld">Children in Westworld</h3>
<h4 id="dont-see-many">Don’t see many</h4>
<p>I feel that this is more than just the logistics of having a show that takes month to produce with a significant amount of time between seasons. Coupled with the fact that the show itself has some very mature subject matter. Maybe I'm reading too much into it but...</p>
<h4 id="all-of-the-ones-weve-seen-have-been-creepy">All of the ones we’ve seen have been creepy</h4>
<p>In the first season,  Lawrence's daughter was the first that I recall saying that the Maze was not for the Man in Black. In this season, we have a creepy Young Ford. 
There are no coincidences. </p>
<h3 id="india-world">India World</h3>
<p>Seriously? I feel that the writers just wanted to show an elephant.</p>
<h4 id="how-is-it-spreading">How is it spreading?</h4>
<p>Whatever it is that is making the hosts turn on humanity is spreading fast. I don't know if it's Ford's last command or the trigger word that is setting them off.</p>
<h4 id="who-is-that-lady">Who is that lady?</h4>
<p>I don't even remember her name. How is it that all the people sent to infiltrate the park are women? Don't get me wrong, I find it a welcome change from what I normally watch.</p>
<h5 id="why-does-she-look-so-much-like-teresa">Why does she look so much like Teresa?</h5>
<p>Maybe all smokers look a like to me, but a lot of her mannerisms remind me of Teresa. It might be why she's willing to shoot someone just to make sure. :)</p>
<h5 id="is-she-dead">Is she dead?</h5>
<p>I don't think so. She's too compelling to just throw away.</p>
<h3 id="dolores">Dolores</h3>
<p>Yes, I went and looked up the right way to spell it.</p>
<h4 id="how-much-of-her-is-wyatt">How much of her is Wyatt</h4>
<p>It seems like she goes back and forth. I would think that Wyatt wouldn't be as much of her personality because a lot of her experience has been as Dolores.</p>
<h4 id="teddy-trouble">Teddy Trouble</h4>
<p>Teddy, Teddy, Teddy... He's just as confused as we are.</p>
<h4 id="is-the-ghost-nation-her-army-or-are-we-just-seeing-wyatts-minions">Is the Ghost Nation her army or are we just seeing Wyatt’s minions</h4>
<p>I don't know. I feel that a lot of them are just following the narrative that was given to them before the end of season 1.</p>
<h3 id="bernard">Bernard</h3>
<p>I like him thus far. I don't know where we're going with this character but it's going to be interesting to see.</p>
<h4 id="not-arnold">Not Arnold</h4>
<p>I'm pretty confident in this. Seeing as he was made after Arnold passed away. I would think that Ford would have a lot of influence on what I would think be his most sentimental creation.</p>
<h3 id="maeve">Maeve</h3>
<p>For me, I'm seeing Maeve as more of a vehicle to see more of the park at this point. I know it is important for her to get her daughter, but we don't know if it will pay off. Please see my small section on creepy kids.</p>
<h4 id="hector-vs-sizemore">Hector vs Sizemore</h4>
<p>I think that this might actually come to a head soon. I'm currently re-watching the first season and I remember how Sizemore was very excited about the speeches and characterization of Hector. It would be nice to see what happens next.</p>
<h4 id="fear-the-ghost-nation">Fear the ghost nation</h4>
<p>The ghost nation is really haunting. I don't know what is going on with them either.</p>
<h5 id="what-happened-in-her-previous-incarnations-how-many-times">What happened in her previous incarnations? How many times?</h5>
<p>Those reveries are really popping up. I think one podcaster was saying it echoes PTSD.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-they-owe-to-each-other-now-bernard-and-dolores">What do they owe to each other now?  Bernard and Dolores</h3>
<p>I feel that of the three major host characters, these two have the strongest connection. Although one sided, they have a history. Does Doloris share some of her memories? Does Bernard attempt to emulate Arnold going forward? I don't know but I'm interest in finding out.</p>

<p>My children were working on school reports today. I don't know what it is but neither one of them like to work with me on stuff like that. Maybe I'm too critical and don't give them the benefit of the doubt for writing at that age. </p>
<p>Too often, I destroy my own writing for even small things.</p>
<p>Either way, I'm going to do the best to highlight the good things about it and only make suggestions on how to improve when they ask. </p>
<p>After all, I won't be able to help them with this later on.</p>

<p>I just noticed that I have a post here for almost every day thus far in May. I think I'm going to leverage that and try to have a post for every day going forward. Some days won't have anything, but will make them either before or after.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that this will help me get ready for <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> this year.</p>

<p>We've been playing together for years and it was amazing to just get be in the same room and make the magic happen.</p>
