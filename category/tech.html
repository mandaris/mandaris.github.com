<p>I spent some time going down a rabbit hole this evening. I've been putting the time in so that I can learn how to program with SwiftUI when I came up with the idea of putting things on my site so that I could show the world my progress.</p>
<p>When I thought about that, I was reminded that I wanted to spruce up the css on the site so that it would look nice.</p>
<p>So, I took some time to load up the static version of my site so that I can see what changes would look like when I update it without regenerating the whole thing with a build of pelican.</p>
<p>I notice that I didn't have an example of several blocks of text (like what you see now).</p>
<p>Sooo...</p>
<p>I spent 5 minutes getting a copy of <code>lorem ipsum</code> because I always think "This is going to be the last time that I'm going to need that. I spent 5 more minutes adding <em>emphasis</em>, <strong>bold</strong>, <a href="#">links</a> and <code>code</code> to it when I realized that I should have something a little more familiar.</p>
<p>That's when I looked up alternatives to "The quick brown fox".</p>
<p>I created a new paragraph using it and then placed that in both my test information and my static site.</p>
<p>Whew... </p>
<p>Ultimately, I spent more time just setting up this demo information for the site then posting about my iOS development.</p>

<p>I'm not too surprised as WWDC is next week and my Mid-2010 iMac cannot run Mojave and certainly won't be able to run whatever else is coming down the pipe.</p>

<p>I've been working in a development environment called <a href="https://www.pega.com">Pega</a> for the last couple of weeks and I kind of like it. It's software that is specialized in handling case management. It's fast to get up and make changes with. It is focused on moving a case through a particular life cycle.</p>
<p>I think the biggest competitor is SaleForce at this point.</p>
<p>To be honest, I'm very cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p>On one hand, this is development work that I'm getting paid to do. I'm excited by it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is another proprietary system that I'll learn without knowing if I'll be able to take the techniques to other places.</p>
<p>I'm going to roll with it for now.</p>

<p>I decided to do this for a couple of reasons.</p>

<p>I've grown a little tired of DropBox taking a lot of resources to sync files that haven't changed. Sometimes, I'll see my computer seemingly ground to a halt for while as DropBox tries to re-index everything. I use it on my families computer and they are already not a fan of the other little utilities that take up resources. </p>
<h4 id="the-second">The second:</h4>
<p>I want to experiment with some other tools. DropBox is still the defacto tool for sync for a lot of people.

<p>Last month, I saw a deal for the setup mac software subscription. I had originally signed up for it when the service started but didn’t continue with it because I was trying to save money and a lot of the applications that they were promoting were things that I had already purchased over the years. Since the deal was essentially %40 off, I thought give it a shot.</p>
<p>So far, I’m really enjoying that it allows me to experiment with different software. In fact, I’ve been writing on the mac power users discourse forums about it and I wanted to put those stories on my blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I really like the idea of SetApp, but I just feel like it came around too late. I am sure that there are gems in there that I don’t know about, but I really wish it was around before I bought Ulysses, CleanMyMac, ForkLift, etc on their own.
I really want to subscribe, but feel like it is a waste due to all the apps I already own.
Anyone else? 
By Bodiequirk ( <a href="https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/lamenting-setapp/6823" title="Forum Post.">link</a> )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I kind of feel the same way when I tried it when it first came out. There were a couple of apps that I kind of wanted to try but I couldn’t justify the cost. At the time, I already owned most of the key software that they had because of different bundles and needs that had come before that.</p>
<p>But then the sale came and I was able to jump on for about $70. I figured this would give me a chance to try out Ulysses and others. The funny thing is that my wife was using our mac to scan something and the software was spitting out a huge pdf. Preview has an option to make a pdf smaller but the quality is unusable. I right clicked to open it up in pdfpen, when I saw that PDF Squeezer was there.</p>
<p>A couple clicks and boom, I was a hero.</p>
<p>One of the few times she’s complemented me on spending money on software.

</blockquote>
<p>I thought that the one time would be good enough to warrant subscribing for next year, but then another incident happened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, another story of how setapp has really saved my bacon and I’ve only had it for about a month.</p>
<p>I’ve given my wife the bad advice of just pulling her thumb drive out of the computer. Well, it just happens that this time it actually became corrupted.</p>
<p>She was <em>furious</em>.</p>
<p>She said -to paraphrase- “only this stuff happens on the mac!”</p>
<p>I know… some of you are thinking that’s grounds for a divorce.</p>
<p>I started to panic, I started questioning all my life choices.</p>
<p>I did a search using Bing! and found some links on how to fix a corrupted USB drive and most of them were to re-format. I didn’t want to take the chance that I’d lose her data, so I did a search for “drive” in the setapp library and saw “Disk Drill”.</p>
<p>It was able to find the files on the usb drive and I restored it to the desktop for my wife to look over.</p>
<p>Marriage saved once again.

<p>With the release of Mohave, I no longer have a desktop computer that can run the latest version of the operating system. Part of me is sad because of the feeling of missing out and that I'm unable to afford a new computer.</p>
<p>Another part of me is relieved in the knowledge that I don't have to worry about my current software not being able to run, having to wait for 3rd to bring support the OS, or further fractioning of what I can and (increasingly) can not do.</p>

<p><img alt="Twitter is a broken plate that held so much potential." src="/images/chuttersnap-478260-unsplash.png" title="Could put twitter together again..."></p>
<p>Recently, there was a post in the mac power users <a href="https://talk.macpowerusers.com/" title="Mac Power Users Discourse Forums.">forums</a> about how <a href="https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/twitter-is-broken/6745/17" title="Twitter is broken">twitter was broken</a> with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, with the recent changes by Twitter and their impacts, does anyone think there’s a real alternative that power users will embrace? If it’s an opportunity to move to something, then who is creating the option that will take us into the next decade of microblogging?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I made a mistake of replying to a sub posting that had the following and not the main post by a user named dotty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t have an answer for you, but I will chime in. I live in Colorado and have come to rely on Twitter for fire and evacuation updates. It is by far the fastest way to get emergency updates. I have an “emergency” group that shows push notifications. All other notifications are turned off if they’re not in that group. Now that push notifications are not allowed on either Tweetbot or Twitterrific, is there another alternative?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I admit I was a little too flippant with my response. Two anxious to really think about my response before posting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that this might be a good thing. Although we won’t get push notifications, the applications will still work.</p>
<p>If anything, this might help those who might have become to the constant notifications.</p>
<p>/Devil’s Advocate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a missed opportunity and got a response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@mandaris , I explained I only used Twitter notifications for emergency notifications about fire and evacuations. I don’t understand how this is a “good thing” for me not to receive this information as quickly as possible. Am I misunderstanding your post? I know you signed it “devil’s advocate,” but seriously??? I sincerely doubt Twitter was trying to do us a favor by restricting their API — It sounds like it was a money decision.</p>
<p>I agree that some are much too attached to their phone and notifications going off every few minutes can be distracting, but that really isn’t the point of this post. There are legitimate reasons someone would want timely push notifications. There was an armed escaped convict in my neighborhood recently and the sheriffs dept put out a twitter notification to stay indoors until the person was apprehended… and then another notification giving the “all clear.” How is it a “good thing” not to receive these types of alerts if you choose to? After, I received a call from my neighbor to check in on me because there was a “reverse 911” that went to her land line and she was concerned I wouldn’t know because I don’t have a land line.</p>
<p>The point of my post is to figure out an alternative now that Twitter has made this decision, not to weigh the merits of notifications from Twitter. After a summer from hell with wildfires raging all around me, these notifications were a blessing. If there were no notifications, all was well, but if my home, or the home of loved ones needed evacuated from fire (or now flash flood) it was a “good thing” indeed to be alerted ASAP. It literally saved lives.</p>
<p>All I want to know now is if I can set up something similar or if I can still receive these notifications another way. If I can still get them and they will be delayed 1-2 minutes that is fine. I only want the notification if it is truly from my emergency list on twitter, and I can’t find a setting for this anywhere with Twitter’s own app. Am I missing something?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very thoughtful, I took the time to write a small response that I hope doesn't erupt into a huge flame war and to appease anyone else who might come across it at a later date.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, I’m happy that the twitter service has helped you and those you care about. Those are all very good use cases and we can all see why Jack Dorsey would state that twitter would drive to be a <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/7/27/17621090/twitter-health-user-growth-q2-earnings-2018-jack-dorsey">daily utility</a>.</p>
<p>But that is the thing, something like that should be a utility that our phones should be able to tap into. For example, I live in California and we have something called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMBER_Alert">Amber Alert</a>. You get alerts without the need for an account. You can get alerts on your phone, billboards and radio.</p>
<p>As a society, we should be making sure that services such as this are expanded to handle use cases as you have described them.</p>
<p>Now, as far as the question of how to use the twitter app to get you what you want. I don’t know if they have a “vip” notification group on the roadmap. I would hope that they discover it needs to be there since they wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re committed to understanding why people hire 3rd party clients over our own apps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably not my greatest moment on the internet but I'm hoping that I communicated my thoughts well. And just in case, I had sent a private message stating that and Doty responded that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re all good.</p>
</blockquote>
