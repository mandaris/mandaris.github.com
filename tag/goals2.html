</header><p>I recently applied to become a professional blogger for macuser.com (a blog run by macworld). As part of the application process, I was to write two articles of 250-300 words to show my qualifications as a writer. I've writen them an have since placed them on my blog.</p>
<p>I remember feeling stressed about creating the entries. Although I like to journal my thoughts time to time. Sitting down and coming up with something for other people to read make me nervous and I had tons of questions like : "What would I write about?", "How can I make what I wrote stand out from the dozens if not hundreds of applicants?" One doubt that really got to e ws the question about how I could do something like this about three times a week and whether or not I truely wanted too.</p>
<p>Now I'm not going to say i'm happy I didn't get the job because I'm not. I would love to get paidfor writing, but I don't think working for macuser at this point in time would be good for the writer in me. I want to be a good write and I feel that writing (like some many other things) needs active practice to get better. The best way to do that is want to write better (other than actually doing it).</p>
<p>At this point, I'm not at the level of <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/author/john-siracusa/">John Siracusa</a> or <a href="http://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc</a>, but they weren't always who they are now.</p>
<p>I can only sit down down and write for my #1 audience and that's me.</p>

<p>The hardest part of starting over is swallowing my pride, saying that I need help and then starting up again.</p>

</header><p>Although you can’t tell by only looking at my blog, but I’ve made a commitment with myself to write more often. It’s usually how I cope with some of the “opportunities” that life presents to me and I typically feel much better about myself and my path in life.</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been having some difficulty getting started on some posts. I catch myself worrying more about what tool I'm going to use then the actual content of m writing.</p>
<p>I was going to wonder what the pros use, but it doesn't matter. The important thing to do is to just write something.</p>
<p>Writers write. Programmer program. Simple.</p>
