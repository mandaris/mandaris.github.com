</header><p>I recently pushed the button to update my site and push my new theme to the world. It felt good to get it out there because it has been dormant for years now and I had thought about shutting it down sometimes. During the time that I had <em>NOT</em> updated, I had switched jobs and kind of doubted everything I was working on.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, the doubt in my own abilities was part of the reason that it took so long to update because I just didn't think that it was good enough. In my mind, I thought "If it's not perfect than I won't show anything at all".</p>
<p>This is the wrong way of thinking about it. </p>
<p>It's almost childish in a way and reminds me of how I'd refuse to write the steps when I was doing my math homework<sup id="fnref:homework"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:homework" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h1>So now what?</h1>
<p>Well, I've got a new redesign that loads really fast and looks pretty cool. The next steps outside of the technical details that I put in my previous post is to find my direction of the site again.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm using <a href="https://dayone.me">Day One</a> for my journal entries and although this is my personal site I don't think I'll be putting entries from there here (more likely is that this entry will be an entry).</p>
<p>I think I'll probably put links to things that are really cool or some tutorials that I've been thinking about making.</p>
<p>We'll have to see.</p>

<li id="fn:homework">
<p>It was something that a couple of high school friends would do. We thought it was cool to get the answer completely in our head without writing all the steps of logic down on paper. It was stupid because the teacher would give you partial credit if you showed your work. &#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:homework" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

</header><p>Today, I've decided that I was going to push my website out to the masses before the end of the week. This is a personal blog and just because it isn't <em>perfect</em> it is something that I created and I want to take pride in the fact that I'm willing to get out there and work on something and make it better.</p>
<p>Some of the things that I'd like to work on will be the handling of navigation at the top and figuring out how to get the tufte style to work properly with pelican. I attempted to get everything working with a liquid tag but the parser doesn't work well with blocklevel tags and wraps it in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> so the expected css doesn't apply properly. This only applies to fullwidth figures but I'd like it all to be uniform.</p>

</header><p>The power went out this morning and left the house in darkness except for my laptop. I took this time to get some work done with my plugin for <a href="http://www.getpelican.com">Pelican</a> but I found myself at a stand still because I wanted to get some information on how regular expressions parse results into a dictionary.</p>
<p>With the internet not working, I decided that I'd try seeing what is available with the REPL in python and I found it to be fairly helpful in the fact that I had access to the documentation in the same interface as the code that I was writing.</p>
<p>In my case, I wanted to find out what methods are part of the match class. Sure, I ran into a minor bump of not knowing how to get help to show me the documentation of match directory, but I quickly got around that by run help on the match object that I created.</p>
<p><img alt="Exploring python in the terminal" src="../../images/Exploring_Python_in_terminal.png" /></p>
<p>Honestly, this gives me a little more confidence in myself that I can find things out on my own without having to turn to the internet and finding myself getting side tracked by all the destractions that someone can find. </p>

<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

</header><p>My personal blog hasn't been changed in over a year. I've been waiting for that perfect moment when it would be ready for the world. Unfortunately, it's been stifled because of my own drive for it to be perfect before it sees the world.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't think anyone reads it and it's not going to get better unless I put some time into it.</p>
<p>But before I put any more effort into it, I want to take some time and write about why I should keep it in the first place.</p>
<h1>Web Technology is cool</h1>
<p>I like working on the web. Until this point, I never thought that I'd be considering a career where I'd be working on the web, but I've spent a lot of my life working or playing with something that is some how web related.</p>
<h2>Play around with different tech</h2>
<p>At the bare minimum, having a website allows you to play around with what can happen on the inter-webs and make that part of what people find when they google, bing or duck-duck-go your name.</p>
<h1>My Part of the web</h1>
<p>Ultimately, having your own website is about control. I control the content and what it looks like and if I choose. I can shut it down.</p>
<h2>Vanity</h2>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>All Me.</p>
<h2>Provide a Place to Share My Opinion</h2>
<p>I don't say much, but I know that this is the perfect platform because I choose to write here and I don't have to worry too much about saying "the wrong thing."</p>

</header><p>When I saw this in the app store, I thought this was an alright game. It had a fairly high rating, but I think that the developers must have gamed the rating system because anyone who has gotten passed the initial tutorial would be quickly bored by the tedious amount of grinding and the amount of in-app purchases that you get hammered with every time you want to do something.</p>
<p>The game has two different kinds of currency: One that proves pointless after 20 minutes and a true currency that you can only get by paying with real money. </p>
<p>Listen, if you're looking for a game that you only play once a day without paying $2-3, then this is it.</p>
