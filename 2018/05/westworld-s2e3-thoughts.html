    <p>So, I've been really digging Westworld and I created this diagram to just contain some of the high level thoughts that I've been having regarding the plot.</p>
<figure><img alt="Westworld Season 2 Episode 3 connections." src="images/westworld-S2E3.png"><figcaption>Westworld Season 2 Episode 3 connections.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'm just going to write a couple things and I'm not even going to take the time to spell check or get the right names for characters.</p>
<h3 id="children-in-westworld">Children in Westworld</h3>
<h4 id="dont-see-many">Don’t see many</h4>
<p>I feel that this is more than just the logistics of having a show that takes month to produce with a significant amount of time between seasons. Coupled with the fact that the show itself has some very mature subject matter. Maybe I'm reading too much into it but...</p>
<h4 id="all-of-the-ones-weve-seen-have-been-creepy">All of the ones we’ve seen have been creepy</h4>
<p>In the first season,  Lawrence's daughter was the first that I recall saying that the Maze was not for the Man in Black. In this season, we have a creepy Young Ford. 
There are no coincidences. </p>
<h3 id="india-world">India World</h3>
<p>Seriously? I feel that the writers just wanted to show an elephant.</p>
<h4 id="how-is-it-spreading">How is it spreading?</h4>
<p>Whatever it is that is making the hosts turn on humanity is spreading fast. I don't know if it's Ford's last command or the trigger word that is setting them off.</p>
<h4 id="who-is-that-lady">Who is that lady?</h4>
<p>I don't even remember her name. How is it that all the people sent to infiltrate the park are women? Don't get me wrong, I find it a welcome change from what I normally watch.</p>
<h5 id="why-does-she-look-so-much-like-teresa">Why does she look so much like Teresa?</h5>
<p>Maybe all smokers look a like to me, but a lot of her mannerisms remind me of Teresa. It might be why she's willing to shoot someone just to make sure. :)</p>
<h5 id="is-she-dead">Is she dead?</h5>
<p>I don't think so. She's too compelling to just throw away.</p>
<h3 id="dolores">Dolores</h3>
<p>Yes, I went and looked up the right way to spell it.</p>
<h4 id="how-much-of-her-is-wyatt">How much of her is Wyatt</h4>
<p>It seems like she goes back and forth. I would think that Wyatt wouldn't be as much of her personality because a lot of her experience has been as Dolores.</p>
<h4 id="teddy-trouble">Teddy Trouble</h4>
<p>Teddy, Teddy, Teddy... He's just as confused as we are.</p>
<h4 id="is-the-ghost-nation-her-army-or-are-we-just-seeing-wyatts-minions">Is the Ghost Nation her army or are we just seeing Wyatt’s minions</h4>
<p>I don't know. I feel that a lot of them are just following the narrative that was given to them before the end of season 1.</p>
<h3 id="bernard">Bernard</h3>
<p>I like him thus far. I don't know where we're going with this character but it's going to be interesting to see.</p>
<h4 id="not-arnold">Not Arnold</h4>
<p>I'm pretty confident in this. Seeing as he was made after Arnold passed away. I would think that Ford would have a lot of influence on what I would think be his most sentimental creation.</p>
<h3 id="maeve">Maeve</h3>
<p>For me, I'm seeing Maeve as more of a vehicle to see more of the park at this point. I know it is important for her to get her daughter, but we don't know if it will pay off. Please see my small section on creepy kids.</p>
<h4 id="hector-vs-sizemore">Hector vs Sizemore</h4>
<p>I think that this might actually come to a head soon. I'm currently re-watching the first season and I remember how Sizemore was very excited about the speeches and characterization of Hector. It would be nice to see what happens next.</p>
<h4 id="fear-the-ghost-nation">Fear the ghost nation</h4>
<p>The ghost nation is really haunting. I don't know what is going on with them either.</p>
<h5 id="what-happened-in-her-previous-incarnations-how-many-times">What happened in her previous incarnations? How many times?</h5>
<p>Those reveries are really popping up. I think one podcaster was saying it echoes PTSD.</p>
<h3 id="what-do-they-owe-to-each-other-now-bernard-and-dolores">What do they owe to each other now?  Bernard and Dolores</h3>
<p>I feel that of the three major host characters, these two have the strongest connection. Although one sided, they have a history. Does Doloris share some of her memories? Does Bernard attempt to emulate Arnold going forward? I don't know but I'm interest in finding out.</p>
