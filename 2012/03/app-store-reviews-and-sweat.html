    <p>Tonight, I wrote a review for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monopoly-hotels/id479412611?mt=8">MONOPOLY Hotels</a>, because I was wanted to rant against what I see as a societal evil. Here it is below.</p>

<p>It's hard for me to understand why some many other people like this game so much. Haven't we all learned the lessons of freemium? </p>
<p>The game starts off free, but in the end it become a very long grind where the only way to make some kind of progress is to pay money for "gold". There is no way that you hard work can balance against that kind of thing and if you spent that much time doing it, just think about what you could have been doing with that time and energy…</p>
<p>Here's a hint: Maybe make your own</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oooo! Harsh, I know. You can actually see society changing as you read every character, but I think the ending is the most important. I would like to see a game that was fun and rewarded players for the hard work that they do but still let those who want to "win" do so. I think I'll spend the next couple of days working on some prototypes to see how much work it would take to make something like this come to life.</p>
<h4 id="fitness">Fitness</h4>
<p>Today was my first time in the gym all year... and maybe all of last year too and I have to say that it was great. I went to innovative fitness and conditioning and it almost seemed like I was having my own personal trainer... that I shared... with 6 people. <em>BUT</em> I don't think I could have done all the exercises on my own.</p>
<p>Definitely, not at this point in my life. I've grown sedentary but going to the gym has really made me want to pursue a more healthier me.</p>
<p>But that could be the exhaustion talking. </p>
<p><em>Still</em>, my wife says that I seem really happy after doing it.</p>
