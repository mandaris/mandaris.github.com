</header><p>Today has been a pretty good day. I got up and was able to get a breakfast for my kids and get them to school on time followed by some quality time with my youngest<sup id="fnref:youngest"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:youngest" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. </p>
<p>Things were going pretty good even though there were a number of bumps along the way. </p>
<p>And then it’s time for bed.</p>
<p>It seems like this is the most difficult time for my family<sup id="fnref:routine"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:routine" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and it is the one that really tries my patience because it is the end of the day and is the last that stands between me and any activities that I want or need to do for that day. I feel that it is because the lack of a consistent schedule is a major reason my wife and I have “issues” with communication and... um... other stuff.</p>

<p>The youngest asked me to pack up a lunch for her and put it in her backpack. I packed the same lunch as I did for my oldest as she requested and then when we got to class she wanted to touch all the toys and wanted to stay after the bell was rung. I had to bribe her with playing my little pony when we got home AND a piggy back ride.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:youngest" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:routine">
<p>I think this is the fault of me and my wife as we do not instill a stable routine with the girls. Too often, we get derailed with activities or some other nonsense like not using the right toothpaste, etc.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:routine" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
