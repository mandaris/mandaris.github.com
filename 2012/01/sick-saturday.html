</header><p>Everyone woke up late today. This is the second time in less than a week that my wife woke up before I did. Maybe I'm losing my touch, maybe I'm just that tired, my fear is that I just don't care as much. For a little more than a year, I've been getting up early to get everyone up so that we can start the day. I dress my children and get lunches ready and this is no easy task when you take into consideration that I'm trying to round up sleepy 2 and 4 year olds. </p>
<p>It really makes me respect single mothers who have to do this all by themselves everyday.</p>
<p>Recently, my youngest has become more and more fussy and I'm having trouble dealing with it. I get the impression that she doesn't hear the word no from other people because that's usually what will set her off on a tantrum. Part of me thinks this has more to do with the fact that she doesn't have a lot of her own activities. As a family, we don't have a lot of time together so a significant portion of it is used to take the oldest one to her events because they don't have a lot of things for a 2 year old to do. I've been thinking about what things I can do so that she gets her own time. </p>
<p>My wife and I have been watching Don Juan DiMarco for the last couple of weeks and it has really made me think about what it means to be romantic. I feel it streams from passion. It is the passion we have for each other and the passion that we have for life itself that makes romance possible.</p>
