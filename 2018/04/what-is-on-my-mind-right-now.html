    <p><img alt="Mindmap of what is on my mind." src="images/what-is-up.png"></p>
<p>I just spent 5 minutes on what are some of the things that are currently on my mind. Honestly, I think I spent more time on the clip art associated with the mindmap than actually thinking about what it means. </p>
<p>I've got a lot of things happening right now and I hoped that putting it in a pretty picture can help me sort it out. So...</p>
<h3 id="whats-up">What’s Up</h3>
<p>Ultimately, I exported the mind map as an outline and decided to  expand it here.</p>
<h4 id="work">Work</h4>
<p>The way that I currently make a living. I find that I'm grinding for someone else and not me or my family.</p>
<h5 id="doing-the-work">Doing the work</h5>
<p>I don't feel that I have a huge problem doing what is asked of me. I <em>do</em> have a problem with the amount of things that need to be done and the amount of support that I'm getting from everyone else. I feel as though a lot of people don't understand that things need to be balanced.</p>
<h5 id="dealing-with-the-people">Dealing with the People</h5>
<p>I do not feel that the people that I'm working with are on the same page. Sometimes, I feel like I'm all by myself on a lot of fronts. I have friends at work, but I also have people who are more into their own ego than getting to the next level in life.</p>
<p>Definitely room for more teamwork. </p>
<h4 id="making-ends-meet">Making ends meet</h4>
<p>Money is absolutely horrible. They say it cannot make you happy, but I find that not having it certainly can make you unhappy.</p>
<h5 id="cutting-expenses">Cutting expenses</h5>
<p>No question. Have to cut back on soo many things. I've started taking my lunch and I've long since stopped buying comic books. The problem is that me and my family like to go out to eat quite a bit.</p>
<h5 id="making-more">Making More</h5>
<p>I've been playing around with the idea of getting a second job. It would have to be a night position, but I don't know if I'd be able to pull it off with the lack of sleep that would eventually happen.</p>
<h4 id="being-fulfilled">Being fulfilled</h4>
<p>This one is just about how I feel about myself. I feel as if I lost my direction in life and I'm really questioning if I had one at all. </p>
<h5 id="what-is-my-current-passion">What is my current passion?</h5>
<p>I like messing around with MacOS X. I love the feel of typing and the pleasure of getting things like my website up and running.</p>
<p>But I want to make something else too.</p>
<p>Not just this blog post but something that can help others, like a tutorial or book.</p>
<h5 id="where-do-i-see-myself-in-the-future">Where do I see myself in the future?</h5>
<p>Unfortunately, the future looks grim. I've got upcoming expenses and less time and resources to deal with them.</p>
<h4 id="having-a-family">Having a family</h4>
<p>The most important aspect. I have a responsibility not just to myself but to other people.</p>
<h5 id="being-able-to-communicate">Being able to communicate</h5>
<p>I want to make sure that my family is able to talk to me if they need to and that I work on my active listening.</p>
<h5 id="making-sure-that-everyone-is-cared-for">Making sure that everyone is cared for</h5>
<p>I love my family and it is important to me that they are happy.</p>
<h3 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h3>
<p>What a small little rant. I feel much better getting that out of my system and will have to review this moving forward.</p>
