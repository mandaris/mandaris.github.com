Today, I got a notification that someone had stolen my account information to buy things online and that my account is going to be closed for the time being. It just goes to show that you have to be on top of this kind of stuff and people will take your money even if you donâ€™t have a lot in the first place.
On top of that, I just got the bill for the fixes to my doorway that was kicked in last year.

*$326!*

You must be out of your mind!

Talk about bad timing!
