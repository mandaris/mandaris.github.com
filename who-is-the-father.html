</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I was driving over to the post office to drop off my unemployment papers and I was thinking about my father. I do respect and love my father, but sometimes I see the scars that life has given him. There are moments where I see the bitterness seeping out of him. </p>
<p>Although I lived in his house for more than half of my life, there are many things I don't know about him. I don't know all the troubles he lived through and there have been times when I've wondered why does he feel a certain way about different things. </p>
<p>There have been many times that he's ranted about something and I've thought he was crazy. The thing is that's I feel that he's right to a degree, but the way he talks about it doesn't help his argument.</p>
<p>The thing is, I don't know much about my father outside of being <em>my father</em>. </p>
<h2>What is important?</h2>
<p>Is it important that I know everything about my dad before he became my dad? No. The important thing is that he loves me and that I can trust him.</p>
<p>The reasons I think about this is that I wonder if he is happy. Is he proud of the majority of his choices in life and whether he's accomplished all of the goals that were truly important to him.</p>
<h2>Are we going anywhere with this?</h2>
<p>There are many times in my life where I've forgotten that how many sibilings that my parent have and what's their names are. I do know that my father has a brother... His name in John. I don't know if it's Jon, Jonathan or John... For a couple of years I thought it was Robert.</p>
<p>Last week, I was driving in the car with my family and I mentioned my brother.</p>
<p>My oldest daughter asked, "You got a brother?"</p>
