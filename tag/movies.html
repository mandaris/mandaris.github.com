</header><p>Today, I stayed home with my oldest. She had woken up with a very pink and very swollen right eye. We didn't know if it was pink eye or something else so we had her stay home and then we took her to the doctor later in the morning. It was pretty nice spending time with her during the day because although the eye looked pretty bad, it didn't really hurt her too much.</p>
<p>She seemed to really enjoy the day that we had together and I even thought about taking her to work tomorrow if her eye doesn't get better. I think it would be nice for her to see where daddy works.</p>
<h2>Playing Hooky</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that I'm not in the office, work still comes in. Normally, this isn't a problem because I would connect to all of my necessary machines remotely ad do the work without having to deal with lag. Things have changed because I've since given away those machines to the guy I'm training to replace me. File transfers are horrible and the performance of the machine is terribly slow when I'm attempting to make a video, run a test or just check my email.</p>
<h2>Star Wars</h2>
<p>For the last week or so, I've been trying to get the girls to sit down and watch Star Wars with me. Apparently, they do not have the patience to learn about a galaxy far, far away... They ask to watch it, but 30 minutes into it they fall asleep or go off and play. </p>

</header><p>Recently, my wife has been listening to the Stephanie Plum audiobook series<sup id="fnref:series"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:series" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and we've both been delighted to have something more to talk about other than typical parent stuff.</p>
<p>Then I heard that they were going to make a movie out of the first book and that the trailer was already online. We even set aside some time to sit down and watch it together.</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>We're already disappointed.</p>
<p>I don't understand why people continue to give this lady movie rolls. Katherine Heigl plays the same uptight woman who "just needs to find the right one so she can relax and enjoy life (AKA get some)". For some reason she reminds me of Lisa Kudrow because I don't see her in anything else but the same role. Listen, I get it there are a lot of people who are uptight and need to relax, but I'm sure a lot of those people still have a fully working personality. Personally, I think the best thing about the trailer is that she only says a total of 4 lines in the whole thing so I'm hoping that this will be like her other movies and she'll be helped by the other actors (queue "Knocked Up").</p>

</header><p>I recently loaned a friend of mine my copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_of_the_paradise" title="Phantom of the Paradise on Wikipedia">Phantom of the Paradise</a> with a note stating that it used to be one of my all time favorite movies. This got me questioning myself on if this was removed from being one of my favorite movies what replaced it?</p>
<p>So here is a list of my favorite movies in no particular order.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120609/" title="The Big Hit on IMDB">The Big Hit (1998)</a>  </li>
</ul>
<p>This was my first taste of comedy/action. It introduced me to a bunch of actors that I'd be happy to see in years to come. Honestly, I knew about Marc Walberg before I ever heard of Marky Mark and I have a little bit of a man crush on Lou Diamond Phillips.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106308/" title="Army of Darkness on IMDB">Army of Darkness (1992)</a>  </li>
</ul>
<p>Hail to the king, baby! The lines are legendary and watching it again just makes me laugh at how I thought the special effects were the greatest. It's almost like watching "The clash of the Titans" with boomsticks.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/" title="Batman Begins on IMDB">Batman Begins (2005)</a>  </li>
</ul>
<p>Restarted a francise and cursed the world with a march of new superhero movies. I thought it was cool that even though it was a Batman movie, you don't see him in costume for half the movie.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266452/" title="Death to Smoochy">Death to Smoochy (2002)</a>  </li>
</ul>
<p>Great film that introduced me to Edward Norton and Jon Stewart. I look at this movie and wonder why Robin Williams isn't in more movies and how come this didn't do better.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103639/" title="Aladdin on IMDB">Aladdin (1992)</a>  </li>
</ul>
<p>A whole new world! One of Disney's most popular male animated characters and I think the best disney soundtrack. Sure the other movies, have great songs but this one has three iconic songs that everyone in my generation can identify.</p>
