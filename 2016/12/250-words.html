</header><p>Today for my creative challenge, I'm going to write 250 words! </p>
<p>I was sending and tweet to Matt Gemmel (a developer who has transitioned to being a writer) asking what kind of exercises does he do to improve his writing. He stated that he writes about himself in third person and then does some fan fiction as well. </p>
<p>I'm going to do something similar to that because I have some desire to be a little bit of a writer as well. </p>
<p>Of course it was part of a dream that I've given up, but I think I should at least work on making it an option. Being able to express my thoughts, feelings and ideas can only help me interact with other people.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I get lonely and I don't know if anyone feels the same way that I do about a lot of things. If I write about what I think, I might find others like me who feel the same way about it.</p>
<p>Or even better, I can understand my own feeling about something and work towards getting a grasp of it. Understand it and do something about it if it is negative.</p>
<p>One last goal is to be able to write for another publication. I feel that I have a unique way of seeing things sometimes. Some of the reports and snippets that I see on the internet are about 250 words and if I could write something that length easily than it would open a lot of doors.</p>
