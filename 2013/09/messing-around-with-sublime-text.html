</header><p>Honestly, a lot of people that I respect are talking about it. I think I'm going to have to step through the tutorial again. But honestly, I'd like to think about what I want to do with it. </p>
<p>I already have a couple text editors but I love messing around with the tools more than doing the job sometimes. </p>
<p>The only reason that I don't use sublime text is because of the price. The "free" demo allows you to use it as long as you want but you see a pop up reminding you that it hasn't been purchased yet. I'm not at a point where I can justify the price and being someone who works in the industry, I want to encourage people to pay for software.</p>
<p>I've talked to some other people and it seems like they are proud of the being able to mentally blockout the popup and dismiss it without missing a beat.</p>
<p>To me, that just seems wrong on so many levels.</p>
