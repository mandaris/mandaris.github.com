</header><p>Today, I really feel like I'm loosing touch with my daughters. Part of me thinks that I maybe overthinking the fact that I've been a little sick and out of it the last couple of days, but another part is worried about the health of the communication between me and my 4 year old daughter.</p>
<p>As soon as I wrote that I thought to myself, 'How can any one unstand the mind of a 4 year old?'. Well, there are books on it so maybe something is there?</p>
<h2>Using your big girl words</h2>
<p>Recently, it feels that our daughters are both not communicating in the best possible way. Both of them seem to yell and whine more than they used to and I find myself thinking that this might be my fault since they are home more. The last couple of weeks have seen the family move into a pattern where things aren't really moving as in a healthy way.</p>
<p>Maybe it's the lack of sleep or the fact that mommy and daddy have had more and more conflict where we aren't talking to each other in a respectful way and the children sometimes hear us.</p>
<p>Maybe it's the fact that our dog died and this is part of the grieving process.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, we have to figure it out and find a way for us as a family to move forward.</p>
<p>The alternative diffinitely won't make anyone happy.</p>
