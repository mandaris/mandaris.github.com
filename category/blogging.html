</header><p>Well, tonight is the night. I got the site design to where I'd like it to be. It's simple, easy to read and very fast. I tried looking at it in a couple of different view ports using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015-505/">Safari's Responsive Design Mode</a> and it made me even more sure about what I'm doing here. </p>
<p>I understand that there are a lot of css/javascript frameworks out there and it would have been <strong>A LOT</strong> easier just to pick something like that and start posting. There is something to be said about just focusing on the actual words that go in the blog instead of how it looks like. I wanted my site to reflect me and what I'm about.</p>
<p><span class='newthought'>This is a message to me</span> that I can complete the goals that I set out to do. It might take me a while but this has been so worth it.</p>
<h1>Next up</h1>
<p>Well, the initial design is done but there are a couple more things that I should probably finish up. </p>
<ol>
<li>Finish the rest of the tags (marginimage, columnimage)</li>
<li>Add the analytics <label for="analytical" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="analytical" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Not a real priority because I don</span></li>
<li>Clean up the Archive page</li>
<li>Create a 404 page</li>
<li>Decrease the spacing between multiple footnotes<sup id="fnref:footnotes"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnotes" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Clean up the regular expressions used to parse for the plugins <label for="irregular" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="irregular" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">During the process of trying to figure out how to do this theme, I spent a lot of time whether to do this in pelican as a plugin or the python markdown. I</span></li>
<li>Discuss Comments</li>
<li>Create options to make it easier to go to categories and tags</li>
<li>OpenGraph</li>
</ol>
<p>I've done a couple comparisons with other pelican templates and I feel that I should have some of this ready for other users who want to try out the Tufte style without worry so much about how it fits with what a website is supposed to do<sup id="fnref:goals"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:goals" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Well, it is getting kind of late for me here and I've got to push the button to make this public to the world.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:footnotes">
<p>When I was first introduced to markdown, one of the things I thought was the coolest was the fact that you could have these little babies to put on the bottom of the page. If you look through my archieves you'll see that I use them off and on to do my writing. Some websites have them at the end or use a popup to show them when you click on them. I think I'll probably move to side and margin notes. Either way, when you get two or more they really start eating up space.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:footnotes" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>It took me a lot of time to pick a template when I first came to pelican and even then I found myself modifying it. &#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:goals" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

</header><p>Today, I've decided that I was going to push my website out to the masses before the end of the week. This is a personal blog and just because it isn't <em>perfect</em> it is something that I created and I want to take pride in the fact that I'm willing to get out there and work on something and make it better.</p>
<p>Some of the things that I'd like to work on will be the handling of navigation at the top and figuring out how to get the tufte style to work properly with pelican. I attempted to get everything working with a liquid tag but the parser doesn't work well with blocklevel tags and wraps it in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> so the expected css doesn't apply properly. This only applies to fullwidth figures but I'd like it all to be uniform.</p>

</header><p>This is just a quick little page that will have some examples of notes used in the Tufte style.</p>
<h1>Margins and Sidenotes</h1>
<p>Anyway, I hope this<label for="Basic-Marginnote" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="Basic-Marginnote" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Margin notes can be used for more than just putting information about a particular article.</span> works or I'm going to have to work on it some more.</p>
<p>Also, I've got to work on sidenotes as well. I was having some problems with sidenotes because I didn't want to copy the code over because sidenotes<label for="siden gt ote-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="siden gt ote-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This is a random sidenote. It doesnt do anything other than let me know that I should be carefull of mixing and matching quotes</span> and margin notes have a lot of commonality.</p>
<h1>Text and blockquotes</h1>
<p>This is just a short section that shows the following block quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Followed by a short list of things</p>
<ul>
<li>Toothpaste</li>
<li>Brushe</li>
<li>Floss</li>
</ul>
<h1>New thoughts</h1>
<p><span class='newthought'>This is the new thought</span> followed by some ipsum text that I found. privacy commons-based peer production Arianna mathewi but what's the business model Tim Carmody metered model Wikipedia, hashtag Snarkmarket digital first hot news doctrine CPC learnings Free Darko Colbert bump <label for="sidenote2-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sidenote2-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This is a second sidenote that Ive put in the text to keep track of how they work together.</span> recontextualize free as in beer privacy A.J.

<h1>Figures</h1>
<p>The first thing I want to put together is the full width images to see if they work well.</p>
<p><figure class="fullwidth"><img src="/2015/12/napoleons-march.png"><figcaption>Napoleon March (Edward Tufte’s English translation)</figcation></figure></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems like pelican is wrapping the figures in p tags so the original css can't format it the way that I'd like.</p>
<p>Followed by some other stuff as well. Like margin images. Like this cool image that I'll eventually put to the side. </p>
<h1>Tables</h1>
<p>This is the section that I'm going to put the tables. I don't think I'll be adding a lot of tables in my own writing, but I feel that I should make sure that something should be here.</p>

</header><p>I just wanted to take a moment to write about what I want my new website to look like. I've been hee-hawing it for years now and I'm starting working on it again. I've found some inspiration in using the Tufte style<sup id="fnref:tufte"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tufte" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and I'll be documenting my changes on this very site. It gives me something to look every time I open up a new safari window.</p>
<h1>Some of the Styles</h1>
<p>As you'll notice the site should be some what simple because I'm learning how to add all the features in pelican using liquid tags. I was thinking about adding a plugin to pelican to turn footnotes into side notes, but I'll hold that off until I get some time to really play with the site design.</p>
<h1>Continued Goals for the Site</h1>
<p>I still have a desire to teach and help people. I've also found that one of those people should be myself. I want to show code examples.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;hello, world&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I'm hoping to have some simple animations and just other stuff.</p>
<p>But first, I'd like to make the site functional on my own.</p>

</header><p>My personal blog hasn't been changed in over a year. I've been waiting for that perfect moment when it would be ready for the world. Unfortunately, it's been stifled because of my own drive for it to be perfect before it sees the world.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't think anyone reads it and it's not going to get better unless I put some time into it.</p>
<p>But before I put any more effort into it, I want to take some time and write about why I should keep it in the first place.</p>
<h1>Web Technology is cool</h1>
<p>I like working on the web. Until this point, I never thought that I'd be considering a career where I'd be working on the web, but I've spent a lot of my life working or playing with something that is some how web related.</p>
<h2>Play around with different tech</h2>
<p>At the bare minimum, having a website allows you to play around with what can happen on the inter-webs and make that part of what people find when they google, bing or duck-duck-go your name.</p>
<h1>My Part of the web</h1>
<p>Ultimately, having your own website is about control. I control the content and what it looks like and if I choose. I can shut it down.</p>
<h2>Vanity</h2>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>All Me.</p>
<h2>Provide a Place to Share My Opinion</h2>
<p>I don't say much, but I know that this is the perfect platform because I choose to write here and I don't have to worry too much about saying "the wrong thing."</p>

At first, I was worried that it would filled with the standard novice information like how to get on the internet being taught by someone took 15 minutes to get some information off the internet and put it into a powerpoint presentation to read to use.</p>

</header><p>I recently came across as <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hyde-dev/browse_thread/thread/db9213433190487f" title="Message post from Google Groups">email</a> from a goggle group that I'm part of that is centered around <a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde" title="Hyde on GitHub">Hyde</a> which is what I'm currently using to statically generate my website/blog. The email was basically asking "What's up with the docs?" and all I can do is just shake my head in agreement. </p>
<p>The problem is that a significant amount of these open source projects are created by people whose talent is mostly with the creation of the tools and not with the associatated docs. This leaves a lot of people in the dust because people see the end result and want to have something cool like that, but don't have the time/desire to dive into the code and learn how it works. </p>
<p>It's not because they are lazy, it because we are all busy people and sometimes we don't need to know every aspect of something to use it. For example, you don't have to be a mechanic to drive your car<sup id="fnref:car"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:car" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Honestly, I wish I could help this guy out because I've had similar problems with this and other projects and it can be daunting to stick your head out and ask the questions. But you have to have the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/12/01/courageous-sucking" title="Photography, and the Tolerance for Courageous Sucking via 43folders">courage to suck</a> in order to get any better at something.</p>
