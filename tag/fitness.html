</header><p>I've signed up for a <a href="https://toughmudder.com">Tough Mudder</a> race in March and I'm woefully unprepared for it. I've been doing small things to increase my physical health, but I've got to change a lot of things if I even want to stand a chance of making it out without getting hurt.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that is the goal for me. It started as a whim but now I want to prove something to myself. I've already made the financial commitment and I need to put my body where my money is.</p>

</header><p>I'm writing this one in bed. </p>
<p>Not the first time for that, but this time is weird. My wife and I haven't said anything beyond "Can I sleep here?" and "If you want to".</p>
<p>I'm going to chalk this up as a result of stress on the both of us after the contract my contract ended. Plus I have some more bad news, I didn't get a job that I really wanted after doing two interviews. I honestly felt that I was a shoe in for the position, so I'm really disappointed.</p>
<p>I thought about starting some kind of video blog of my progress on how I attempt to find employment and talked about it with my friend, Nick. </p>
<p>The first thing he asked me was if I had ever thought about doing a kickstarter to get a business going and what it would be. It was then, that I told him about a half thought about what I would do if I couldn't find a job. </p>
<p>We decided to meet up tomorrow and talk about what things we can do moving forward. </p>
<h2>Working out</h2>
<p>Tomorrow, I start working out at intence fitness and I'm a little worried about how it is going to turn out. I haven't been to the gym in years and this is promising to be a unique experence. </p>
<p>I'm going because I have a one month voucher, but I don't know if I'll be staying because... well, I don't have a job. Plus the place doesn't seem to be that proffesional. I called them twice on Monday and didn't get a call back until 4pm that day.</p>
<p>We'll see.</p>
