</header><p>So this post is more of a follow up to explain my logic for what I'm doing. Sometimes, it's just good to write out your thoughts.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>I find myself putting more and more of my thoughts into mindmaps. I will have to come up with a way to put them into better drafts.</figcaption><img src="../../images/Create_something_everyday.png"/></figure></p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>What would making something every day do for me?  That was the question that I asked myself. I've been missing something for months if not years and it was the satisfaction that I was creating something meaningful outside of being a parent. I was feeling helpless and I was slowly seeing things not getting done. </p>
<p>I was losing control.</p>
<p>I feel that this will allow me a jump start into taking some control. </p>
<p>As opposed to learning to control my body via exercise and meditation<sup id="fnref:meditation"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:meditation" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>What Counts</h2>
<p>The last two are things that I've never made before and I'd like to make it part of my challenge to get something in front of other people. Honestly, I don't know how many people read my blog anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog Entries</li>
<li>Tutorials</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Examples</li>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Vlog</li>
</ul>
<h2>What doesn’t count</h2>
<p>These are things that I was doing anyway and I don't want to make it part of the challenge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Journal Entries</li>
<li>Tweets</li>
</ul>
<div class="footnote">

</header><p>The first thing that I'd like to work on is getting the article header that I'm using to be more capable of handing meta data for individual entries. Currently, it points to the specific url for the article but I'd like it to take my current header.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">title</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Where</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">put</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">maybe</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">someday</span>

</pre></div>


<p>and add the <code>link</code> attribute</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">title</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Where</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">put</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">maybe</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">someday</span>

<span class="n">link</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">some_other_place</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">com</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I started off with the following jinja heading.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">&lt;h1&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;a rel=&quot;bookmark&quot;</span>
<span class="x">   href=&quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.url</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot;</span>

<span class="x">   </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.title</span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To be honest, I don't do development on the blog that often so I used my own code to look up how to do an <code>if</code> statement in jinja and wrote a little test line to see if it worked.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.title</span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">article.link</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.link</span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endif</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>After editing the page a number of times and doing more research that I should have into which kind of <code>rel</code> tag I should use for book marks versus external links, I finished up with this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">article.link</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot;</span>

</header><p>So, I'm making a commitment to myself to create something every day until Christmas without the limitation/structure of saying what I'm going to be making during this period of time.  I suspect that it will mostly be blog posts and tutorials but I think I'll make a push to clean up the code for this blog and add a number of things that I've been putting on the back burner.</p>

</header><p><figure class="fullwidth"><img src="http://quotidianquest.com/images/omnifocus_printout_256.png"><figcaption>I felt I needed to unplug so I printed out what is in Omnifocus</figcation></figure></p>
<p>Today, I did a review of my projects in OmniFocus. And thought about if I really, really wanted to keep certain things in there. The key to any good productivity system is having trust in that it is working correctly. If I have things in the system that I'm not going to do, then a part of me is going to subconsciencely fight against it.</p>
<h2>So, why are things in omnifocus in the first place?</h2>
<p>Well, these were things that I wanted to do at some point in time and it has become very easy to add things to the inbox.  Anything that I put into reminders<sup id="fnref:reminders"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:reminders" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> or send directly from Safari or the mail drop. </p>
<p>When I attempt to get organized, I typically try to use omnifocus because a lot of people in my circle of influence use it when they are feeling overwhelmed. I like it because I'm somewhat familiar with it. Also, when I feel like going back to pencil and paper, I can print out everything to act as a starting point.</p>
<h2>So, where am I going to put all this stuff than?</h2>
<p>I've been thinking about it a lot recently. For a while, I was keeping a couple text files that would have information about different projects that I would like to do. I'd access them via nvAlt.</p>
<p><figure class="fullwidth"><img src="http://quotidianquest.com/images/nvalt_text_notes.png"><figcaption>A small sample of some of the notes that I keep</figcation></figure></p>
<p>This allowed them to be saved in dropbox so that I could access them on different computers. The only problem is that a majority of the things that I was interested in starting would something that I found on the web (an article or how to).  </p>
<p>I've thought about moving everything to evernote. It's a service that allows me to connect to my mac and also allows me to use windows as well. In fact, I've been using it more and more this year in order to help me track all the job applications that I submitted to the state government.</p>
<p><figure class="fullwidth"><img src="http://quotidianquest.com/images/evernote_application_log.png"><figcaption>With Evernote, I am able to keep track of all the applications I put in so that I can review and follow up.</figcation></figure>. </p>
<p>The reason that I'm not a fan of this is because I don't know what is going to happen with the future of the business. Although I have a premium membership, I don't think the new price is worth it for what I use it for. Nor do I think I can afford it the next time that renewal is up.</p>
<p>This leaves, me with Apple's Notes.app. It has really been making the rounds as far as praise from a lot of the people that I respect and has been fairly easy to use. The only problems that I'm worried about going forward with this the ability to add something to a pre-existing note when the list of notes starts to get longer. I like the fact that everything I put in it gets pushed to the server and is then on my device. I also like the idea of being able to have an easy way of sharing notes with my wife and look forward to more features in the future.</p>
<h2>In conclusion, where am I going to put my notes.</h2>
<p>I think I'll be giving evernote another chance for being the place that I keep my maybe-someday list for projects<label for="maybe_evernote" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="maybe_evernote" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/images/maybe_someday_evernote.png" alt="Evernote allows me a place to sort things that I do not want to see in my review"/><br/>Evernote allows me a place to sort things that I do not want to see in my review</span>. Although there is some uncertainty in the future of the service, it still works at this point and I don't imagine that it will be difficult to leave it in the future. I even went back and tried linking some notes together and I think I can come up with some really nice uses for that going forward.</p>

<p>This actually works too well because sometimes, I put geo location and times with the reminders and this doesn't get translated when it makes the move to omnifocus.

</header><p>I recently spent some time chatting on the internet about some of the problems that I've been having with getting things done since my "fun-employment" the last couple of months. It is very hard for me, because I've been told that I'm smart and have potential all of my life and here I am in my mid 30's and there aren't a line of people knocking on my door to give me money.</p>
<p>When I did this, I felt good. </p>
<p>I felt like I wasn't just someone lost in the wind. </p>
<p>I'm going to stay involved with the community and make it my touch stone as I work towards finding more work.</p>

</header><p>Recently, <a href="http://quotidianquest.com/2016/04/my-thoughts-on-text-expander.html">I posted about my thoughts on Text Expander</a> after they announced that they were going to be moving to a subscription. And I got some feedback regarding what I wrote. I've pasted it below because I honestly don't get any feed back regarding any of my writing<label for="feedback" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="feedback" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Most likely because I do not have comments on the site</span>. </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>I completely agree that they have kind of boxed themselves out of the "casual user" market and are now more focused on "power users" or those that are using this tool on multiple devices (like me)</li>
<li>I think your point is very well written, but would love to see more information about the alternative (AutoHotKey) that you have selected. </li>
<li>Perhaps it would be helpful to mention a couple of things (If any) that could make textexpander that tool for you again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Great job though. You can definitely tell that you care about the company.</p>
<p>It's just they don't fit in your system anymore (which happens)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like feedback. At this point, good or bad I'm happy with the fact that someone else is reading and it gives me some motivation to make the writing better. In this case, I'd like to further expand on the last two points in the reverse order.</p>
<h1>3. How to make the tool more helpful for me</h1>
<p>This is actually a something that needs to happen on my end<label for="disservice" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="disservice" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">To be fair, the application tries its best to help me be as productive as possible.</span>.

Plus all the the writing that I've been doing.</figcaption><img src="../../images/my_textexpander_setup_2016-04.png"/></figure></p>
<p>The application does help in one major way everyday (when I do use it). Most mornings, I do use it to create my grateful journal template<sup id="fnref:affirmation"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:affirmation" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.  Here is a brief example of the template that I use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre># Things I&#39;m Grateful for #
+ 

# Things I&#39;m Excited about #
+ 

# One Thing I&#39;d like to focus on #
</pre></div>


<p>By default, the application will monitor what you type and suggest even more snippets that you can add to your collection.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>I was kind of shocked by some of the things that I write multiple times and it has the possibility of helping me change some habits.</figcaption><img src="../../images/my_textexpander_suggestions.png"/></figure></p>
<p>Maybe, I shouldn't have freaked out when I saw this feature pop up and you can always change the way it works in the preference because it could have been helpful. But it seemed creepy and annoying. </p>
<p><figure><figcaption>Part of me was getting annoyed with all the notifications on what I could use as a snippet.</figcaption><img src="../../images/my_textexpander_preferences_2016-04.png"/></figure></p>
<p>If you're feeling adventurous you can even go to the website of one of my heroes <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a> and check out his page of <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/te-tools/">text expander tools</a>. </p>
<p>Despite all this, I still find that I wasn't using it to the fullest<label for="text_expander_usage" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="text_expander_usage" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="../../images/my_textexpander_usage.png" alt="This was my last usage stat.

Take it with a <em>HUGE</em> grain of salt because I only have it on my laptop and I do frequent re-installs</span>. Ultimately, we all have to balance what we want versus what we need the money to go to.</p>
<h1>2. AutoHotKey</h1>
<p>On this topic, I don't have much to say because I no longer have a windows machine to use on a day to day basis. The great thing about this tool was that I was using it to now only fire off extensions but to launch applications and replicate user interactions for testing.</p>
<p>I would often use a keyboard short cut to launch the vnc client because the laptop that was given to employees to use might not be that powerful or we wanted to run a test on another machine that had a faster connection. </p>
<p>For user interactions, I created a script that would type in the keyboard shortcut that would make windows rotate the screen or do a series of mouse clicks to reproduce... something...</p>
<h1>1. Updated...</h1>
<p>While I was writing this, Smile reduced the price to $20 a year for the software. Which changes the deal significantly. Now I have to think about what the software is going to do for me going forward. Is this going to save me time in the future? Will I save more time than the time that I used writing about it here? </p>
<p>I don't know.</p>

</header><p><a href="https://textexpander.com">TextExpander</a> is a tool that I forget that I have. Actually, TextExpander is a tool that I forget to use. In the last couple of years, I've moved to a workflow that really isn't working for me day to day. I have a laptop, an imac, a couple ipads and all the work computers<sup id="fnref:windows"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:windows" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that have been supplied for me to use in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>Recently, the people at Smile software have switch the software to be a subscription model. On one hand, I understand that some companies need to do this to keep their businesses afloat; the monthly revenue is better to budget against versus someone purchasing the software every major release (maybe). On the other hand, this means that as a user I don't "own" the software; I'm leasing<label for="leasing" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="leasing" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">It seems to be the trend nowadays that people pay a fee to use things from homes(rent), cars and music. I do not have a problem with it, but it seems like a lot of money is going to things that we will not be able to get some equity back from.</span> it.</p>
<p>Honestly, I can see why they would do something like that. The company specializes in tools like this and pdfpen and I like the fact that they sponsor a lot of podcasts that I listen to. I wish them well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be joining them on this experiment. I'm not a power user of the software. Because of the way that I've been living my technical life, I haven't seen myself repeating a lot of text. You can probably see the result of this in the fact that I don't post that often. The header for this posting is stored as a text expander snippet but I find myself having to look it up in order to use it.</p>
<p>I wish them luck and I'm happy to use my current version until it stops working.</p>
