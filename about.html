<h2>Me:</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Mandaris Moore. I'm this guy... you know... Anyway, I've been messing around on the internet for a while. I'm interested in a lot of things; mac programming, accessible web design and self improvement.</p>
<p><em>Self improvement</em> For most of my life, I've been plagued with low self-esteem and questions about who I am and what I want to do with my time on this planet. In recent years I've narrowed my goals to the following priorities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be a good father</li>
<li>Be the best person I can be</li>
</ol>
<p>The second goal feed into the first but it's important that I put the children first.</p>
<h2>Site:</h2>
<p>This site used to be hosted on Google's blogger, but with recent changes in how people communicate on the internet, I wanted more control over my voice on the web. I know that a lot of people enjoy social media sites such as twitter and facebook, but I wanted to have a place where my long form thoughts can be all my own.</p>
<p>Before I set up the site, I established a couple key goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Easy to maintain</em><br />
I want to be able to post quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Easy to move to different services</em><br />
Don't want to be stuck in one system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Simple Formatting</em>
Should be able to read the bare html easily (should be tidy).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Accessible</em><br />
Easy for the seeing impared as well as easy to navigate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>HTML5</em><br />
Use semantics for everything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Easy URLs</em><br />
I don't like posts that have hostname.com/fjkadsjdfjaskdflsjdk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Support Tags</em><br />
I want to be able to find all the posts with a certain tag or keyword</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The site design is based off of the beginner's tutorial created by <a href="http://www.quotidianquest.com">Merlin RebroviÄ‡</a> for the <a href="http://hyde.github.com">Hyde project</a>. It is included in Hyde as a layout named <em>starter</em>.
If you have a <a href="http://hyde.github.com/install.html">default Hyde installation</a>, all you have to do is
write:</p>
<pre><code>hyde -s folder_name create -l starter
</code></pre>
<p>To check for the newest version, to download it separately or to report
