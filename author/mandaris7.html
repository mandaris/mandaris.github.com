      What is on my mind right now
    </a>
  </h2>
</header><div class="e-content post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
<figure><img alt="Mindmap of what is on my mind." src="images/what-is-up.png"><figcaption>Mindmap of what is on my mind.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I just spent 5 minutes on what are some of the things that are currently on my mind. Honestly, I think I spent more time on the clip art associated with the mindmap than actually thinking about what it means. </p>
<p>I've got a lot of things happening right now and I hoped that putting it in a pretty picture can help me sort it out. So...</p>
<h3 id="whats-up">What’s Up</h3>
<p>Ultimately, I exported the mind map as an outline and decided to  expand it here.</p>
<h4 id="work">Work</h4>
<p>The way that I currently make a living. I find that I'm grinding for someone else and not me or my family.</p>
<h5 id="doing-the-work">Doing the work</h5>
<p>I don't feel that I have a huge problem doing what is asked of me. I <em>do</em> have a problem with the amount of things that need to be done and the amount of support that I'm getting from everyone else. I feel as though a lot of people don't understand that things need to be balanced.</p>
<h5 id="dealing-with-the-people">Dealing with the People</h5>
<p>I do not feel that the people that I'm working with are on the same page. Sometimes, I feel like I'm all by myself on a lot of fronts. I have friends at work, but I also have people who are more into their own ego than getting to the next level in life.</p>
<p>Definitely room for more teamwork. </p>
<h4 id="making-ends-meet">Making ends meet</h4>
<p>Money is absolutely horrible. They say it cannot make you happy, but I find that not having it certainly can make you unhappy.</p>
<h5 id="cutting-expenses">Cutting expenses</h5>
<p>No question. Have to cut back on soo many things. I've started taking my lunch and I've long since stopped buying comic books. The problem is that me and my family like to go out to eat quite a bit.</p>
<h5 id="making-more">Making More</h5>
<p>I've been playing around with the idea of getting a second job. It would have to be a night position, but I don't know if I'd be able to pull it off with the lack of sleep that would eventually happen.</p>
<h4 id="being-fulfilled">Being fulfilled</h4>
<p>This one is just about how I feel about myself. I feel as if I lost my direction in life and I'm really questioning if I had one at all. </p>
<h5 id="what-is-my-current-passion">What is my current passion?</h5>
<p>I like messing around with MacOS X. I love the feel of typing and the pleasure of getting things like my website up and running.</p>
<p>But I want to make something else too.</p>
<p>Not just this blog post but something that can help others, like a tutorial or book.</p>
<h5 id="where-do-i-see-myself-in-the-future">Where do I see myself in the future?</h5>
<p>Unfortunately, the future looks grim. I've got upcoming expenses and less time and resources to deal with them.</p>
<h4 id="having-a-family">Having a family</h4>
<p>The most important aspect. I have a responsibility not just to myself but to other people.</p>
<h5 id="being-able-to-communicate">Being able to communicate</h5>
<p>I want to make sure that my family is able to talk to me if they need to and that I work on my active listening.</p>
<h5 id="making-sure-that-everyone-is-cared-for">Making sure that everyone is cared for</h5>
<p>I love my family and it is important to me that they are happy.</p>
<h3 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h3>
<p>What a small little rant. I feel much better getting that out of my system and will have to review this moving forward.</p>

</figure>
<p>I like writing. I find it very relaxing and it allows me to get my thoughts together. Recently, I've gotten out of the habit of writing on a regular basis so I'm going to take this as an opportunity to start journaling again in the month of May.</p>
<p>I'll set a goal to start the day with a little bit of yoga followed by some writing on what I want to do with the day. Maybe some introspection as well.</p>
<p>If I had it my way, I'd put this all into DayOne, but it has been kind of stressful having it there where I don't have any control over when it goes away.</p>

<p>I'm going to be changing the pelican posts that I have that use the <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/plantuml">PlantUML</a> plugin to be in the <code>draft</code> status.</p>
<p>I really enjoy having a way to put my words into a diagram, but I honestly haven't had a need to and having my computer pause for a second as it starts up java to render the diagrams everytime has gotten a little annoying. </p>
<p>Going forward, I'll use an application to create the diagrams and then just add them to my images directory.</p>

<p>A thought it would be nice to have a better way of making diagrams from my phone. I’ve been lusting after OmniGraffle for years but I don’t have the money or drive to invest into unlocking the full power. </p>
<p>So thought I would try one of the many free apps in the store. I can’t say that I like it too much at this point as it completely deleted an item I was trying to resize. Still, you get what you pay for and I’m starting to rethink my idea of using my iPhone as a place to make something like this. </p>

<p>Tonight, I changed the ssh keys on my computer and I had a really hard time connecting to the server that my site is hosted on. </p>
<p>The server has some really tough firewalls and it doesn't allow you multiple attempts to log in. You only get one and if it doesn't work you get banned. I had to have a friend unlock my account 4 times as I learned more about what keys to use and how does the pass phrase on the factor into all of this. </p>
<p>It's really late so I hope that I remember this. </p>
<p>Just in case here are the links I used to get more information.</p>

<p>I did Toast Masters today and I even managed to get a little award for best "Table Topics".  It is an event where you select a random topic and speak about it for 2 minutes. </p>

<p>Today, I’ve put some time into improving something that I’ve been thinking about doing for years. And that is having my static <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com">pelican</a> powered website update without me over seeing it. </p>
<p>In a lot of ways this is me getting out of my own way and just spending time producing words instead of focusing on the technology. In other words, writing the words instead of making pages. </p>
<figure><img alt="Hazel sorts all the blog posts into sub folders." src="/images/hazel-sorts-posts-in-chronicles.png"><figcaption>Hazel sorts all the blog posts into sub folders.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s mostly just the one hazel rule to constantly keep the posts sorted and then there is a keyboard maestro rule that waits for the computer to be idle for 30 minutes[^waiting] before making all the posts. </p>
<p>The only thing I want to improve is adding images and editing posts from the past.  I'll leave that for another day.</p>

<p>I was thinking about doing some kind of challenge for the month of April. I wasn't really able to start yesterday, but today is a great to start with something new. </p>
<p>Here are somethings that I'm thinking about working on</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing. I want to work on my communication via writing. I think that I can be better served by focusing on making my writing better. Both with grammar and how I express ideas.</li>
<li>Web Design. Just making it look nicer would make me feel better about giving the url to people</li>
<li>Planning. Setting more time to work on things that need to be improved.</li>
