<p>I've been using streaks and the fact that I've been feeling a little lost to start journalling a little more seriously recently. Things are falling apart in little ways here and there. </p>
<p>It feels like my wife and I are definitely on different pages and stuck in a rut as it were.</p>
<p>Our home has problems with mold again.</p>
<p>Our youngest is having trouble walking.</p>
<p>And we have to face the possibility that we won't be able to move up to better housing at the end of October.</p>
<p>Very stressful.</p>
<p>One of the few things that I have control over is my time journalling and how I approach this problem.</p>
<p>I don't want to feel too overwhelmed.</p>

<p>One of my co-workers is Catholic and was going to give up his daily routine of drinking a <a href="https://us.coca-cola.com/coke-zero-sugar/" title="Enjoy the real taste of Coca-Cola in a zero calorie, sugar free beverage.

<p>I wasn't thinking...</p>
<p>I decided to give up <strong>BOTH</strong> BBQ sauce and comics.</p>
<p>I've been fiending for both since that moment. </p>
<p>In fact, I woke up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Wednesday" title="Ash Wednesday is a Christian holy day of prayer and fasting.">Ash Wednesday</a> fiending for something smoothered in sauce.</p>
<p>For comics, I've even stopped myself from watching anything that is animated because I think of it as a moving comic.</p>
<p>It's been hard to relax, but it has made me look into other sauces and I'm doing a lot more work around the house.</p>

<p>I decided to do this for a couple of reasons.</p>
<h4 id="the-first">The first:</h4>
<p>I've grown a little tired of DropBox taking a lot of resources to sync files that haven't changed. Sometimes, I'll see my computer seemingly ground to a halt for while as DropBox tries to re-index everything. I use it on my families computer and they are already not a fan of the other little utilities that take up resources. </p>
<h4 id="the-second">The second:</h4>
<p>I want to experiment with some other tools. DropBox is still the defacto tool for sync for a lot of people. I still have it installed on my devices<sup id="fnref:resume"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:resume">1</a></sup>, but I see a lot of new applications that would allow me to be a lot more flexible. For example, if I place the files in a git repo, I can have more control of sharing and version history.</p>

<p>I really like that my children are going to see a Science Fiction movie. When I was a kid there weren't a lot of heroes that looked like me. Sure, there were black super heroes. But they were usually some buff side kick or characature; mostly muscle and charisma. </p>
<p>I like the fact that they are showing women in movies that are more than just a side character.</p>

<p>I've been listening to <a href="https://coreint.org" title="A podcast about indie software development for the Mac, iOS and other Apple technologies.">Core Intuition</a> for years, because it was great to hear how independent developers go about making a living. When I'm sweating to make a living by working on someone else's schedule, I'd listen to how they are making ends meet while still enjoying life. I might not always agree with what they were saying but something about how they viewed themselves and their business gave me hope that you could follow your passions in life.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://coreint.org/2018/11/episode-351-heres-the-downside/">Episode 351: Here's The Downside</a>, Daniel talked about how his application, <a href="https://red-sweater.com/marsedit/" title="Write, preview, publish, and archive your blog from a Mac.">MarsEdit</a>, wasn't making as much money as he hoped. </p>
<p>It shook me.</p>
<p>I had been hearing for years how many developers were having the same problems. In my mind, I thought that this was a great product that should be seen as a great reason to use the Mac.</p>
<p>I've identified myself with Daniel many times over the years and want him to succeed. To be the little guy who is making it.</p>
<p>I haven't finished the episode.</p>
<p>I'm afraid to.</p>
<p>For some reason, I feel that if I don't finish it. It won't be as bad as what the worst case scenario could be.</p>

I had originally signed up for it when the service started but didn’t continue with it because I was trying to save money and a lot of the applications that they were promoting were things that I had already purchased over the years. Since the deal was essentially %40 off, I thought give it a shot.</p>
<p>So far, I’m really enjoying that it allows me to experiment with different software. In fact, I’ve been writing on the mac power users discourse forums about it and I wanted to put those stories on my blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I really like the idea of SetApp, but I just feel like it came around too late. I am sure that there are gems in there that I don’t know about, but I really wish it was around before I bought Ulysses, CleanMyMac, ForkLift, etc on their own.
I really want to subscribe, but feel like it is a waste due to all the apps I already own.
Anyone else?

<p>I kind of feel the same way when I tried it when it first came out. There were a couple of apps that I kind of wanted to try but I couldn’t justify the cost. At the time, I already owned most of the key software that they had because of different bundles and needs that had come before that.</p>
<p>But then the sale came and I was able to jump on for about $70. I figured this would give me a chance to try out Ulysses and others. The funny thing is that my wife was using our mac to scan something and the software was spitting out a huge pdf. Preview has an option to make a pdf smaller but the quality is unusable. I right clicked to open it up in pdfpen, when I saw that PDF Squeezer was there.</p>
<p>A couple clicks and boom, I was a hero.</p>
<p>One of the few times she’s complemented me on spending money on software.

<p>I thought that the one time would be good enough to warrant subscribing for next year, but then another incident happened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, another story of how setapp has really saved my bacon and I’ve only had it for about a month.</p>
<p>I’ve given my wife the bad advice of just pulling her thumb drive out of the computer. Well, it just happens that this time it actually became corrupted.</p>
<p>She was <em>furious</em>.</p>
<p>She said -to paraphrase- “only this stuff happens on the mac!”</p>
<p>I know… some of you are thinking that’s grounds for a divorce.</p>
<p>I started to panic, I started questioning all my life choices.</p>
<p>I did a search using Bing! and found some links on how to fix a corrupted USB drive and most of them were to re-format. I didn’t want to take the chance that I’d lose her data, so I did a search for “drive” in the setapp library and saw “Disk Drill”.</p>
<p>It was able to find the files on the usb drive and I restored it to the desktop for my wife to look over.</p>
<p>Marriage saved once again.

<p>With the release of Mohave, I no longer have a desktop computer that can run the latest version of the operating system. Part of me is sad because of the feeling of missing out and that I'm unable to afford a new computer.</p>
<p>Another part of me is relieved in the knowledge that I don't have to worry about my current software not being able to run, having to wait for 3rd to bring support the OS, or further fractioning of what I can and (increasingly) can not do.</p>

<p><img alt="Two puzzle pieces coming together via pexels.com" src="images/pexels-photo-164531.jpeg" title="Trying to put all the pieces together to get this working!"></p>
<p>The more that I dive into the quest of having my own spot on the internet, the more that I find that I have things that I want to do with it. Which means more research, experiments and late nights. </p>
<p>Currently, I'm on a mission to get webmentions and pingback working on my site. It's been pretty slow going because I want to incorporate it into my current blogging workflow. A workflow that is currently not flowing at all<sup id="fnref:flow"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:flow">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought I'd focus on making some changes so that I can make it fit better with all the new stuff that is coming out for the <a href="https://indieweb.org" title="The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the &quot;corporate web&quot;.">indieweb</a>.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-sign-in">Setting up sign in</h3>
<p>The first thing to do is make some changes to my template to allow for sign up according to the <a href="https://indieweb.org/How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain" title="How to setup web sign-in on your own domain.">web directions</a></p>
<p>I thought the easiest ways of doing this was to use github<sup id="fnref:github"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:github">2</a></sup> or twitter<sup id="fnref:twitter"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:twitter">3</a></sup>. I pushed the github login near the top of the page so that it would look for it first.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">GITHUB_USERNAME</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;!-- IndieWeb sign-in --&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;link rel=&quot;me&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">GITHUB_USERNAME</span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot; /&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endif</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I then included the twitter login information with the rest of the twitter information.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">TWITTER_USERNAME</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;!-- Twitter Specific Info --&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:site&quot; content=&quot;@</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">TWITTER_USERNAME</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot; /&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:creator&quot; content=&quot;@</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">TWITTER_USERNAME</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot; /&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:card&quot; content=&quot;summary_large_image&quot; /&gt;</span>
<span class="hll"><span class="x">&lt;link rel=&quot;me&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">TWITTER_USERNAME</span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot; /&gt;</span>
</span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endif</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="setting-up-webmentions">Setting up webmentions</h3>
<p>After the login was set up, I added this to enable webmentions that are specific to any website that uses the template.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">WEBMENTIONS</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;!-- Enabling webmention functionality --&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;link rel=&quot;pingback&quot; href=&quot;https://webmention.io/</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">WEBMENTIONS</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">/xmlrpc&quot; /&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;link rel=&quot;webmention&quot; href=&quot;https://webmention.io/</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">WEBMENTIONS</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">/webmention&quot; /&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endif</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Unfortunately, I still need to test it and get it in front of other people to use. I'm going to lay the foundation down and do some research so that I can get ping backs to work properly.</p>
<h3 id="more-meta-data">More meta data</h3>
<p>From my reading of indieweb.org, I see that it doesn't use the <a href="https://mandarismoore.com/2018/06/blog-accomplishments.html" title="The Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph.">OpenGraph</a> and <a href="https://schema.org" title="Schema.org is a set of extensible schemas that enables webmasters to embed structured data on their web pages for use by search engines and other applications.">Schema.org</a> that I <a href="https://mandarismoore.com/2018/06/blog-accomplishments.html" title="My accomplishments on this blog">put in</a> the theme. </p>
<p>I'm hesitant to add these new tags because it lowers the validation scores, but I hope that it will help with accessibility and just make the site work better for those who want to find it.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I've got a lot of things on my mind and places where I can make the site move forward. I hope that those who read this feel inspired and have some input on how to make the template better. </p>
<p>If so, the theme can be found <a href="https://github.com/mandaris/modest" title="A very simple template for pelican">here</a>.</p>
