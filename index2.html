</header><p>I recently spent some time chatting on the internet about some of the problems that I've been having with getting things done since my "fun-employment" the last couple of months. It is very hard for me, because I've been told that I'm smart and have potential all of my life and here I am in my mid 30's and there aren't a line of people knocking on my door to give me money.</p>
<p>When I did this, I felt good. </p>
<p>I felt like I wasn't just someone lost in the wind. </p>
<p>I'm going to stay involved with the community and make it my touch stone as I work towards finding more work.</p>

</header><p>Recently, <a href="http://quotidianquest.com/2016/04/my-thoughts-on-text-expander.html">I posted about my thoughts on Text Expander</a> after they announced that they were going to be moving to a subscription. And I got some feedback regarding what I wrote. I've pasted it below because I honestly don't get any feed back regarding any of my writing<label for="feedback" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="feedback" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Most likely because I do not have comments on the site</span>. </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>I completely agree that they have kind of boxed themselves out of the "casual user" market and are now more focused on "power users" or those that are using this tool on multiple devices (like me)</li>
<li>I think your point is very well written, but would love to see more information about the alternative (AutoHotKey) that you have selected. </li>
<li>Perhaps it would be helpful to mention a couple of things (If any) that could make textexpander that tool for you again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Great job though. You can definitely tell that you care about the company.</p>
<p>It's just they don't fit in your system anymore (which happens)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like feedback. At this point, good or bad I'm happy with the fact that someone else is reading and it gives me some motivation to make the writing better. In this case, I'd like to further expand on the last two points in the reverse order.</p>
<h1>3. How to make the tool more helpful for me</h1>
<p>This is actually a something that needs to happen on my end<label for="disservice" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="disservice" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">To be fair, the application tries its best to help me be as productive as possible.</span>.  The people at smile give you a number of examples that you can use right away to save you time.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>When I was making this post, I added one more. If anything knowing that I might have to give the application up has sparked new interest in using it. Plus all the the writing that I've been doing.</figcaption><img src="../../images/my_textexpander_setup_2016-04.png"/></figure></p>
<p>The application does help in one major way everyday (when I do use it). Most mornings, I do use it to create my grateful journal template<sup id="fnref:affirmation"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:affirmation" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.  Here is a brief example of the template that I use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre># Things I&#39;m Grateful for #
+ 

# Things I&#39;m Excited about #
+ 

# One Thing I&#39;d like to focus on #
</pre></div>


<p>By default, the application will monitor what you type and suggest even more snippets that you can add to your collection.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>I was kind of shocked by some of the things that I write multiple times and it has the possibility of helping me change some habits.</figcaption><img src="../../images/my_textexpander_suggestions.png"/></figure></p>
<p>Maybe, I shouldn't have freaked out when I saw this feature pop up and you can always change the way it works in the preference because it could have been helpful. But it seemed creepy and annoying. </p>
<p><figure><figcaption>Part of me was getting annoyed with all the notifications on what I could use as a snippet.</figcaption><img src="../../images/my_textexpander_preferences_2016-04.png"/></figure></p>
<p>If you're feeling adventurous you can even go to the website of one of my heroes <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a> and check out his page of <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/te-tools/">text expander tools</a>. </p>
<p>Despite all this, I still find that I wasn't using it to the fullest<label for="text_expander_usage" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="text_expander_usage" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="../../images/my_textexpander_usage.png" alt="This was my last usage stat. Take it with a *HUGE* grain of salt because I only have it on my laptop and I do frequent re-installs"/><br/>This was my last usage stat. Take it with a <em>HUGE</em> grain of salt because I only have it on my laptop and I do frequent re-installs</span>. Ultimately, we all have to balance what we want versus what we need the money to go to.</p>
<h1>2. AutoHotKey</h1>
<p>On this topic, I don't have much to say because I no longer have a windows machine to use on a day to day basis. The great thing about this tool was that I was using it to now only fire off extensions but to launch applications and replicate user interactions for testing.</p>
<p>I would often use a keyboard short cut to launch the vnc client because the laptop that was given to employees to use might not be that powerful or we wanted to run a test on another machine that had a faster connection. </p>
<p>For user interactions, I created a script that would type in the keyboard shortcut that would make windows rotate the screen or do a series of mouse clicks to reproduce... something...</p>
<h1>1. Updated...</h1>
<p>While I was writing this, Smile reduced the price to $20 a year for the software. Which changes the deal significantly. Now I have to think about what the software is going to do for me going forward. Is this going to save me time in the future? Will I save more time than the time that I used writing about it here? </p>
<p>I don't know.</p>

 #<a href="http://quotidianquest.com/tag/text-expander.html">text expander</a></span></p>
</header><p><a href="https://textexpander.com">TextExpander</a> is a tool that I forget that I have. Actually, TextExpander is a tool that I forget to use. In the last couple of years, I've moved to a workflow that really isn't working for me day to day. I have a laptop, an imac, a couple ipads and all the work computers<sup id="fnref:windows"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:windows" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that have been supplied for me to use in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>Recently, the people at Smile software have switch the software to be a subscription model. On one hand, I understand that some companies need to do this to keep their businesses afloat; the monthly revenue is better to budget against versus someone purchasing the software every major release (maybe). On the other hand, this means that as a user I don't "own" the software; I'm leasing<label for="leasing" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="leasing" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">It seems to be the trend nowadays that people pay a fee to use things from homes(rent), cars and music. I do not have a problem with it, but it seems like a lot of money is going to things that we will not be able to get some equity back from.</span> it.</p>
<p>Honestly, I can see why they would do something like that. The company specializes in tools like this and pdfpen and I like the fact that they sponsor a lot of podcasts that I listen to. I wish them well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be joining them on this experiment. I'm not a power user of the software. Because of the way that I've been living my technical life, I haven't seen myself repeating a lot of text. You can probably see the result of this in the fact that I don't post that often. The header for this posting is stored as a text expander snippet but I find myself having to look it up in order to use it.</p>
<p>I wish them luck and I'm happy to use my current version until it stops working.</p>

I write all of my blog post in markdown and store them in a folder in dropbox. From there, I use pelican to turn the files into a webpage.  The steps would be...</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Byword or <a href="http://multimarkdown.com/index.html">MultiMarkdown Composer</a></li>
<li>Write the post</li>
<li>Remember the textexpander snippet that I created for post headers because I don't post as often as I used to</li>
<li>Save the file</li>
<li>Copy the file to location where I have pelican looking<sup id="fnref:publish"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:publish" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Generate the site</li>
<li>Publish the site by copying the generated file to the proper git repository</li>
<li>Push the repository</li>
<li>Check that all the links work</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, I decided that I've already bought tons of productivity tools and should use them for what they are for. I had a couple workflows in the past but not saving them while I switch between betas causes the system to falter. </p>
<p>It's not the complicated rule set, but it certainly a start and makes me happy that I'm actual using the things that I've bought. </p>

 #<a href="http://quotidianquest.com/tag/blog.html">blog</a> #<a href="http://quotidianquest.com/tag/open-graph.html">open graph</a></span></p>
</header><p>So,  I spent about 3 hours working on getting Open Graph tags to work in the theme that I created. I've got mixed feeling about it because I started off by adding the tags to the base html template using an if statement and it seemed a little clunky.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">OPEN_GRAPH</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;meta property=&quot;og:title&quot; content=&quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">SITENAME</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot;/&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;meta property=&quot;og:type&quot; content=&quot;website&quot;/&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;meta property=&quot;og:description&quot; content=&quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">SITE_DESCRIPTION</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot;/&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;meta property=&quot;og:url&quot; content=&quot;</span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">SITE_URL</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x">&quot;/&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endif</span> <span class="nv">OPEN_GRAPH</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>This worked for the site in general but doesn't translate to all the articles and this caused me to go into a some what deep dive into how Pelican and Jinja parses blocks and if statements. I started off with putting all the tags into the base and then doing individual changes to tags that need to be changed for. </p>
<p><strong>BAH!!!</strong></p>
<p>So, took a step back and looked into what plugins were already available. And there is was! <a href="https://github.com/whiskyechobravo/pelican-open_graph">Pelican-open_graph</a>! I was home free! Or so I thought, until I tried to use it. The plugin has three problems. </p>
<h2>It doesn't  account for when someone does <em>not</em> have a modified date on their articles.</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AntoineVe/pelican-open_graph">Luckily, someone had put a solution up</a>. The change was forked about 7 months ago today and it looks like whoever created the open graph plugin has taken a break to work on other things.</p>
<h2>It's a year old and hasn't made the changes for pelican regarding summaries of articles.</h2>
<p>So, I had to do some debugging to find out that the code needed to be changed in the following way<sup id="fnref:payitforward"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:payitforward" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">ogtags</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s">&#39;og:description&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">instance</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">metadata</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;og_description&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                                                           <span class="n">instance</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">metadata</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;summary&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                                                                                 <span class="n">instance</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">summary</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>It also assumed that every article has some kind of tag.</h2>
<p>I've decided to just punt this problem and add the tags to the 6 articles that don't have them, but than I took a second look at the problem because the perfectionist in me doesn't like to leave problems unsolved and I didn't want to track down what the particular articles were.</p>
<p>So, I just wrapped the code in a try block to make sure that I got this particular exception.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">tag</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">instance</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tags</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">AttributeError</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">ogtags</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="s">&#39;article:tag&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;untagged&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Ultimately, I got to learn a little bit more about using pelican and knocked off a major milestone on getting this blog to where I'd like it to be.</p>

</header><p>I recently pushed the button to update my site and push my new theme to the world. It felt good to get it out there because it has been dormant for years now and I had thought about shutting it down sometimes. During the time that I had <em>NOT</em> updated, I had switched jobs and kind of doubted everything I was working on.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, the doubt in my own abilities was part of the reason that it took so long to update because I just didn't think that it was good enough. In my mind, I thought "If it's not perfect than I won't show anything at all".</p>
<p>This is the wrong way of thinking about it. </p>
<p>It's almost childish in a way and reminds me of how I'd refuse to write the steps when I was doing my math homework<sup id="fnref:homework"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:homework" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h1>So now what?</h1>
<p>Well, I've got a new redesign that loads really fast and looks pretty cool. The next steps outside of the technical details that I put in my previous post is to find my direction of the site again.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm using <a href="https://dayone.me">Day One</a> for my journal entries and although this is my personal site I don't think I'll be putting entries from there here (more likely is that this entry will be an entry).</p>
<p>I think I'll probably put links to things that are really cool or some tutorials that I've been thinking about making.</p>
<p>We'll have to see.</p>

<p>It was something that a couple of high school friends would do. We thought it was cool to get the answer completely in our head without writing all the steps of logic down on paper. It was stupid because the teacher would give you partial credit if you showed your work. &#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:homework" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
