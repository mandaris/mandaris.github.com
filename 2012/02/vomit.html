    <p>This morning, I woke up to vomit.</p>
<p>After a very long night filled with little ones who don't like sleeping in their own beds by themselves coming to invade mommy and daddy's bed, I was awakened to a desperate plea for water. </p>
<p>I ran to get the water, she took two sips and then promptly threw up...</p>
<p>... in the bed</p>
<p>... on the way to bathroom</p>
<p>... not in the bathroom</p>
<p>... but on the way out</p>
<p>Luckily, my wife was able to take care of her during the day. So that I could go to work and train my replacement some more. </p>
<h4 id="oh-the-horrors">Oh, the horrors</h4>
<p>For the last year, I've been busy at work attempting to get an automated tool to work as it was designed. In fact, at one point I was attempting to automate the automated tool so that everyone could benefit by not running it. Personally, I thought this was a pointless endevour. </p>
<p>What is the point of automating an automated tool? Especially when that first tool is being modified and changed on an almost daily basis.</p>
<p>Well, I managed to get the system somewhat working but I found myself having to do a significant amount of working trying to fix other issues and it kind of died.</p>
<p>But the problems still persist. I welcome automation, but I have to question the logic when were are stacking issues upon issues like this.</p>
<h4 id="improvements-in-writing">Improvements in writing</h4>
<p>I've been doing this 250 word thing for almost 3 weeks now and I haven't done any editing on entries that I make. The original goal of this project was to get my thoughts out of my head and have something to look at as an achievement. I'm currently debating on whether I should read them because the process might make me too self conscience to write more.</p>
