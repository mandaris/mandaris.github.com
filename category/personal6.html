</header><p>Respect is very valuable to a relationship. When we decide to trust someone with our hearts there is a rule, either spoken or commonly understood, that the two people in the relationship will respect each other as human beings. Sometimes we forget, sometimes we take each other for granted, but if you continue to disrespect your partner, you're going to have some real problems.</p>
<h3>On the Hunt</h3>
<p>In other news, I'm wondering how all of this is going to pan out. Time is running out...</p>
<p>I've thought about what kind of goals I'd like to reach in the next couple of days and I think they are pretty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T">S.M.A.R.T</a>.</p>
<h3>Training Others</h3>
<p>I'm still training my replacement at my current job and it has definitely been a unique experience for me. To me, I see this as more evidence of our disposable culture. My employer sees me as a tool that can easily be replaced. This flies in the face of my goal of being someone that doesn't need a rèsumè in order to get hired. </p>
<p>As far as the company is concerned, this is standard business practice. A way to cut cost by not paying benefits and then being able to let people go without any remorse. </p>
<p>Listen, if you don't like it. You don't have to work here.</p>
<h4>Project Development</h4>
<p>I'm kicking around a couple ideas at the moment and they will continue to be ideas for the foreseeable future due to some time contraints I'm under. I don't want to put anything here because that would be another commitment that I've got to think about. </p>
<p>I'll just add it to OmniFocus for now.</p>

</header><p>My wife's sister has just had a horrible experience attempting to get her car fixed. The problem all started when she had a car accident one night<sup id="fnref:car crash"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:car crash" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and the car was totaled. Others would have cut their loses then and there, but I think that because this was the first car that she bought with her own money she saw it as something worth saving<sup id="fnref:saving"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:saving" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and has literally spent enough money in repairs that she probably could have bought a new one.</p>
<p>I really feel sorry for her. The world does not have an easy way of telling us wether or not something is good deal and when it comes to mechanics, even if they are honest, it doesn't mean that they know what they are doing. I've run into my fair share of people who simply want to make the most money they can from you. I've heard people say that the price for anything is "what the customer can afford". </p>
<p>What are we doing to each other? It seemed like "Honest work for honest pay" is a forgotten concept in our ever consumer focused world.</p>

</header><p>Today, I met my replacement at work.</p>
<p>He's a lot older than I expected<sup id="fnref:expected"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:expected" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> which got me worried. How bad is it out there to find a job?</p>
<p>But it also got me thinking about how our disposable culture. How is it even though everyone seemed to like me at work that I'm still facing a hard end date for leaving and finding something else. I was part of the team, a reliable rock that could get things moving...</p>
<p>But in a couple weeks, I'll be gone and that person I trained will be doing what I did for them. </p>
<p>Honestly, I don't blame the guy and <em>some</em> people have said that I should withhold some of the knowledged that I've accumulated along the way, but I won't do that because I don't need the bad karma and I'm not in the business of burning bridges. The guy is actually pretty nice and was quiet and just soaked up what I was telling him.</p>
<p>He generally liked my teaching style<sup id="fnref:teach"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:teach" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and we even had a great discussion about how development works. I spent a lot of time explaining things and it was nice to show someone all the little things that I have to do every day. I wish him the best, but I wish for better things going forward.</p>

</header><p>This weekend, was good to me. I managed to spend sometime with my family, get some rest and look for a new job without feeling that I was cheat so other important goal. Still, I don't think that new job is going to fall into my lap, but I'm optimistic that if worse comes to worse, I can find something to keep the lights on and make sure that my family isn't hungry.</p>
<p>I believe in myself and I believe in the power of family. </p>
<p>When I write it down it does sound like and affirmation, but I don't see that as a problem. What is wrong with having a positive attitude? It seems that a lot of people don't feel the need to grasps the importance of simply enjoying the moment. Like they  are saving all the happy moments for some grand retirement in the bahamas.</p>
<p>Well, I can tell you this now.</p>
<p>Nothing is guaranteed and -honestly- nothing is "deserved".</p>
<p>Not the retirement. Not happiness. Not even that career for working your ass off in college. People change, plans change. If you haven't heard this yet, I'm sorry to busrt your bubble and be <em>that</em> guy.</p>
<p>For example, I was always told I was smart. I was told that I'd go far in life. I played by the rules given to me and ultimately my career has not come to fruition (just yet). </p>
<p>The only things in this world that I have at this point in life is the love of my family and friends. It is partially for them that I'm able to get up in the morning and I'm grateful. </p>
<p>Sure, it isn't guarunteed that the will be in the greatest of moods, but there is love there.</p>

</header><p>Everyone woke up late today. This is the second time in less than a week that my wife woke up before I did. Maybe I'm losing my touch, maybe I'm just that tired, my fear is that I just don't care as much. For a little more than a year, I've been getting up early to get everyone up so that we can start the day. I dress my children and get lunches ready and this is no easy task when you take into consideration that I'm trying to round up sleepy 2 and 4 year olds. </p>
<p>It really makes me respect single mothers who have to do this all by themselves everyday.</p>
<p>Recently, my youngest has become more and more fussy and I'm having trouble dealing with it. I get the impression that she doesn't hear the word no from other people because that's usually what will set her off on a tantrum. Part of me thinks this has more to do with the fact that she doesn't have a lot of her own activities. As a family, we don't have a lot of time together so a significant portion of it is used to take the oldest one to her events because they don't have a lot of things for a 2 year old to do. I've been thinking about what things I can do so that she gets her own time. </p>
<p>My wife and I have been watching Don Juan DiMarco for the last couple of weeks and it has really made me think about what it means to be romantic. I feel it streams from passion. It is the passion we have for each other and the passion that we have for life itself that makes romance possible.</p>

</header><p>In the past, I've thought about becoming my own boss and running a small business where I make up the rules and direct my energy and focus on something that I enjoy. True, starting out, I would probably have to submit myself to the whims of whatever customers I'd potentially have, but I have a desire to have more control over my career. Not saying that people who work for others don't have that kind of control, so much as to say that I've met more than a few people who want have expressed thoughts of "why did they do this or that" at all the companies I've been at<sup id="fnref:company"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:company" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Recently, I've come across a job posting for a programming position at Intel and wanted to apply for it. If I get selected for an interview and get past that there is a programming test with a catch<sup id="fnref:catch"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:catch" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>...</p>
<p>... <em>IF I FAIL</em>, not only will I not get hired. I won't be able to interview with Intel again for an undefined time. </p>
<p>Now, I understand why Intel has done this there are a lot of people out there looking for jobs who look good on paper and may do well in an interview. How do you reduce the amount of people you have to look at if there is a chance that someone who bubbled up from the heap comes back?</p>
<p>It is making me pause.</p>
<p>But my final thought is, I could apply and not get the job or I could sit here and do nothing garuntee I won't get it.</p>

</header><p>So I'm messing around with plaintext to see how it might fit into my workflow. It seems like it moves pretty fast. I.m going to try simple note late on and see if that makes for a better experience when it comes to writing.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm leaning more towards a Dropbox based solution because that has a versioning system and that will help me... Some how?</p>
<p>Had a great conversation with my wife about a lot of things. What I liked best about it was we weren't talking about something important but that we listen to each other. Two individuals who wanted to share their thoughts and opinions, it's something we definitely need more of because I don't want to wake up one day next to a stranger.</p>

 #<a href="http://quotidianquest.com/tag/parenting.html">parenting</a></span></p>
</header><p>Today we took my oldest to her karate class and it was entertaining. When she first started she would spin around and dance when the instructor was giving the lessons. I was tempted to pull her out of class until I felt she was old enough, but my wife insisted that if we just give her time and reminded me that we honestly couldn't beat the price for entertainment. I couldn't argue against it because the alternative would be to trying to find something else to do during that time and I didn't like my wife's idea of cruising through the mall.</p>
<p>So, we kept going to class and I found myself getting more and more frustrated as she danced and pranced around while all the other kids tried hard to making it through the lessons. I became one of those over baring parents that you see in the movies (constantly telling my kid not to do this or that). Then one day, something happened... she asked me not to watch her.</p>
<p>My daughter...</p>
<p>...didn't want me to be part of this.</p>
<p>At first, I was upset. I mean, <em>I was trying to help her get it right!</em> </p>
<p>It took a while to dawn on me. Was I really helping her by constantly correcting her? She's four years old, she shouldn't have to worry about being perfect. As a parent, I only get one chance to experience these things. I was forcing my own perfectionist views on my daughter and if I wasn't carefull I'd plant a seed doubt in her that would nag her for the rest of her days just like me.</p>
<p>So, one day. I set her down (as best as I can) and told her that I love her and would always be proud of her. I stopped trying to "couch" her and now she asks that I come to her classes. She smiles when I tell her that I saw what she was doing in class. And most important to me, she's proud of herself.</p>

</header><p>It's almost 2 O'clock in the morning and I'm having another one of those nights where I can't sleep and the only thing on my mind is all the things I need to do and all the things that I've done wrong. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>How am I going to do this?
Why did I do that?
If only such and such hadn&#39;t happened.
</pre></div>


<p>It's hard for me sometimes to see some of the good things that I've done and how I'm making some progress going forward. </p>
<p>I think that's part of the reason that I started doing this, so that I can get my thoughts out of my head and actually do something else. So what is on my mind?</p>
<p>Tonight, I was thinking about all the people who I feel have taken advantage of me. Part of me forgives them because it is ultimately me who gives them the power over me, but other parts of me is bitter that they would go on with their life and never look back and help me with my situation. A card, a friendly email, something to acknowledge that I helped them get to where they are.</p>
<p>But the world isn't like that and me waiting for that to happen is only going to turn me into a bitter old man instead of the slightly bitter person I'm turning into now.</p>
<p>I've got to stop being so jaded in my life, my daughters are looking up to me as an example of what a person is supposed to be and as an inspiration of what a man can do.</p>

</header><p>I think one of the benefits of doing this project and making myself write on the computer is that I don't have as much anxiety about writing on a computer. The thoughts and words are appearing to me as fast as they would when I write on paper. In addition, thanks to applications like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12">Byword</a> that allow me to ignore all the spelling mistakes until I'm ready to correct them (if I choose to). My current work flow is to open up a new document and then just start writing until I meet the word requirements and finish my last thought. From there, I give the document a title, created date and tags then save it in a folder structure called "Chronicles" which then separates the entries by year and month. I'll probably set up some kind of folder action to just sort the files after saving, but -for now- I'm focused on the actual writing versus the tools and tech surrounding it.</p>
<p>Today, I spent some one on one time with my oldest daughter to just play around and have fun. I had asked her if she'd rather make cookies with me which is something that we've been doing more and more of but she seemed to really like the idea of just the two of us using our imagination<sup id="fnref:imagination"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:imagination" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I did my best to keep up with all the ideas that she made up but I think my favorite one was the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sarah Milkins
She's a Princess Scientist horse who succeed when everyone said it was impossible<sup id="fnref:impossible"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:impossible" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.<br />
She's 4-5 years old.<br />
Goes to school a lot, even when she gets fussy...<br />
Doesn't get fat when she gets older<sup id="fnref:fat_and_old"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fat_and_old" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.<br />
There are only a few of them... But there is a lot of others and tons of information about them.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was just so exciting to see her talk about this idea and we both went to the rest of the family to share. It was one of those great moments when a parent can just sit back and enjoy the their little one's creation.</p>
<p>After that, we sat in front of the computer and giggled making little movies in PhotoBooth... This was a wonderful evening.</p>
