    <p>I recently pushed the button to update my site and push my new theme to the world. It felt good to get it out there because it has been dormant for years now and I had thought about shutting it down sometimes. During the time that I had <em>NOT</em> updated, I had switched jobs and kind of doubted everything I was working on.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, the doubt in my own abilities was part of the reason that it took so long to update because I just didn't think that it was good enough. In my mind, I thought "If it's not perfect than I won't show anything at all".</p>
<p>This is the wrong way of thinking about it. </p>
<p>It's almost childish in a way and reminds me of how I'd refuse to write the steps when I was doing my math homework<sup id="fnref:homework"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:homework">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="so-now-what">So now what?</h3>
<p>Well, I've got a new redesign that loads really fast and looks pretty cool. The next steps outside of the technical details that I put in my previous post is to find my direction of the site again.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm using <a href="https://dayone.me">Day One</a> for my journal entries and although this is my personal site I don't think I'll be putting entries from there here (more likely is that this entry will be an entry).</p>
<p>I think I'll probably put links to things that are really cool or some tutorials that I've been thinking about making.</p>
<p>We'll have to see.</p>

<p>It was something that a couple of high school friends would do. We thought it was cool to get the answer completely in our head without writing all the steps of logic down on paper. It was stupid because the teacher would give you partial credit if you showed your work.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:homework" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
