<p>I joined mastodon.cloud last night because of all the drama with Twitter the in the last couple of years. I haven't been personally attacked by bots or nazi, but I don't believe that I should have to worry about something like that.</p>
<p>Although, I'm hesitant to join <em>yet another</em> social media platform when I can barely keep up with the ones that I'm in now (facebook, micro.blog, slack, and reddit), I thought it would be ok to at the very least reserve my name in case I do decide to use it.</p>

<p><img alt="Twitter is a broken plate that held so much potential." src="/images/chuttersnap-478260-unsplash.png" title="Could put twitter together again..."></p>
<p>Recently, there was a post in the mac power users <a href="https://talk.macpowerusers.com/" title="Mac Power Users Discourse Forums.">forums</a> about how <a href="https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/twitter-is-broken/6745/17" title="Twitter is broken">twitter was broken</a> with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, with the recent changes by Twitter and their impacts, does anyone think there’s a real alternative that power users will embrace? If it’s an opportunity to move to something, then who is creating the option that will take us into the next decade of microblogging?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I made a mistake of replying to a sub posting that had the following and not the main post by a user named dotty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t have an answer for you, but I will chime in. I live in Colorado and have come to rely on Twitter for fire and evacuation updates. It is by far the fastest way to get emergency updates. I have an “emergency” group that shows push notifications. All other notifications are turned off if they’re not in that group. Now that push notifications are not allowed on either Tweetbot or Twitterrific, is there another alternative?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I admit I was a little too flippant with my response. Two anxious to really think about my response before posting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that this might be a good thing. Although we won’t get push notifications, the applications will still work.</p>
<p>If anything, this might help those who might have become to the constant notifications.</p>
<p>/Devil’s Advocate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a missed opportunity and got a response.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@mandaris , I explained I only used Twitter notifications for emergency notifications about fire and evacuations. I don’t understand how this is a “good thing” for me not to receive this information as quickly as possible. Am I misunderstanding your post? I know you signed it “devil’s advocate,” but seriously??? I sincerely doubt Twitter was trying to do us a favor by restricting their API — It sounds like it was a money decision.</p>
<p>I agree that some are much too attached to their phone and notifications going off every few minutes can be distracting, but that really isn’t the point of this post. There are legitimate reasons someone would want timely push notifications. There was an armed escaped convict in my neighborhood recently and the sheriffs dept put out a twitter notification to stay indoors until the person was apprehended… and then another notification giving the “all clear.” How is it a “good thing” not to receive these types of alerts if you choose to? After, I received a call from my neighbor to check in on me because there was a “reverse 911” that went to her land line and she was concerned I wouldn’t know because I don’t have a land line.</p>
<p>The point of my post is to figure out an alternative now that Twitter has made this decision, not to weigh the merits of notifications from Twitter. After a summer from hell with wildfires raging all around me, these notifications were a blessing. If there were no notifications, all was well, but if my home, or the home of loved ones needed evacuated from fire (or now flash flood) it was a “good thing” indeed to be alerted ASAP. It literally saved lives.</p>
<p>All I want to know now is if I can set up something similar or if I can still receive these notifications another way. If I can still get them and they will be delayed 1-2 minutes that is fine. I only want the notification if it is truly from my emergency list on twitter, and I can’t find a setting for this anywhere with Twitter’s own app. Am I missing something?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very thoughtful, I took the time to write a small response that I hope doesn't erupt into a huge flame war and to appease anyone else who might come across it at a later date.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, I’m happy that the twitter service has helped you and those you care about. Those are all very good use cases and we can all see why Jack Dorsey would state that twitter would drive to be a <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/7/27/17621090/twitter-health-user-growth-q2-earnings-2018-jack-dorsey">daily utility</a>.</p>
<p>But that is the thing, something like that should be a utility that our phones should be able to tap into. For example, I live in California and we have something called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMBER_Alert">Amber Alert</a>. You get alerts without the need for an account. You can get alerts on your phone, billboards and radio.</p>
<p>As a society, we should be making sure that services such as this are expanded to handle use cases as you have described them.</p>
<p>Now, as far as the question of how to use the twitter app to get you what you want. I don’t know if they have a “vip” notification group on the roadmap. I would hope that they discover it needs to be there since they wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re committed to understanding why people hire 3rd party clients over our own apps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good discussion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably not my greatest moment on the internet but I'm hoping that I communicated my thoughts well. And just in case, I had sent a private message stating that and Doty responded that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re all good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm about to do a review of what needs to be done this week and I'm hesitant to start. Although I've been getting better at making sure that things get done, the sheer amount of "stuff" can feel overwhelming if I look at all of it at once. </p>
<p>I think that is why I find myself drawn to OmniFocus and GTD in general. It give me a tool that allows me to trust that what I'm <em>not</em> doing is correct.</p>
<p>But back to the matter at hand, what should my next project be?</p>
<h3 id="moving-the-site-generation-to-another-server">Moving the site generation to another server</h3>
<p>Currently, I have a iMac at home that generates the site and then <code>scp</code> the files to a server. The only times that I have had an issue is when I had to shut down dropbox running on the machine because it was being a resource hog.</p>
<p>My plan is to move all of my posts to a repository and then having a cron job running on the server to do an update every hour to update the repository and then the website. </p>

<p>Previously, I had written about how I found a solution to my compulsion to make sure that the headers on my blog were on the write<sup id="fnref:write"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:write">2</a></sup> level <a href="getting-mdx_downheader-to-work.html" title="Getting MDX_Downheader to work">here</a>.</p>
<p>As with so many other things in life, there was an easier<sup id="fnref:easy"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:easy">1</a></sup> solution that was built into python-markdown.</p>
<p>When I had first explored this issue, I had looked at the <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/header_id/" title="Automatically generates id attributes.">HeaderID</a> it was marked as being deprecated and to be used for adding anchors for headings. I didn't read the whole thing because it didn't seem it would fit my needs. I continued on and found my current solution.</p>
<p><em>But</em>, the thought that there could be a better way kept on nagging me even though I was happy<sup id="fnref:happy"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:happy">3</a></sup> with how my site turned out.</p>
<p>As I was in the process of updating my <a href="https://github.com/mandaris/pelican-test-content" title="Simple pelican articles to test new themes.">Pelican Test Content</a>, I went back to the <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/" title="A compilation of various Python-Markdown extensions">python-markdown extensions page</a> to make sure that I had covered most of the use cases. I noticed that it had a <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/toc/">Table of Contents</a>.</p>
<h3 id="all-about-that-base">All about that base</h3>
<p>The first thing that I found was that the extension allows me to set the <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/toc/#usage">base for headers</a> fairly easily by setting a property in my <code>pelicanconfig.py</code>. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Markdown options</span>
<span class="n">MARKDOWN</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;extension_configs&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.codehilite&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;css_class&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;highlight&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.extra&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.meta&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
<span class="hll">        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.toc&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;baselevel&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;3&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;title&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Table of Contents&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This eliminates the need for the additional plugin and as an added bonus allows me to have a table of contents for those really long posts that I never write.</p>
<h3 id="table-of-pain">Table of Pain</h3>
<p><img alt="The html that is generated is hard to read." src="images/table-of-pain.png">
There are only a couple mild things that I don't really enjoy about this new solution. </p>
<h4 id="div-ided-we-stand-on-syntax">Div-ided we stand on syntax</h4>
<ul>
<li>I'd love if this wasn't in a <code>div</code> and used either a <code>nav</code> or <code>aside</code> tag for accessibility and my own personal comfort. </li>
<li>Also, the number of <code>li</code> and <code>ul</code> tags can be hard to read if you want to read the raw html.</li>
<li>Titles for table of contents is in a <code>span</code> tag. I find that kind of ironic. </li>
</ul>
<p>Seriously, just nitpicky at this point.</p>
<h4 id="making-it-look-nice">Making it look nice</h4>
<p>This part is just me going back to trying to figure out how to make it look nice in the browser. I imagine that it won't take long, but there are going to be a couple of ugly iterations.</p>

<p>I'm in the bedroom upstairs. It's kind of like an office because it has a desk and no one to bother me at the moment. It gives me a second to think about what I'm going to do next in life. </p>
<p>I usually take some time to go through my list of projects in OmniFocus or read through my emails. Throughout the years, I find myself using the default mail client that comes with macOS.</p>
<p>I think that it is because the first time that I really enjoyed working with email was in college which is when I started using macOS.</p>
<p>Of course, I have a couple posts about how I used <a href="/2010/01/how_i_use_email.html" title="An old post">web clients</a> but I find that I use my laptop when I really want to clean up what's in my inbox.</p>

      Productivity review

  </h2>
</header><div class="e-content post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Moving forward has gotten easier and easier to do. I'm definitely on an upswing when it comes to most of my goals for the last couple of months.</p>
<p>What am I attributing this new to this success?</p>
<p>More regular reviews via OmniFocus and a desire to accomplish what I set out to do.</p>
<p><img alt="A brief look at what I'm supposed to be doing today." src="/images/OmniFocus-today-July.jpeg"></p>
<p>For the longest time, I would have OmniFocus on my laptop and and iPhone and just wish that it would organize my life - that everything would just fall into place by some kind of magic. I think this is why productivity software will always be in demand. People want things to happen, but they forget that it's just a tool and if you don't change who you are or your approach to the problem nothing is going to happen.</p>
<h3 id="reflecting-in-what-needs-to-change">Reflecting in what needs to change</h3>
<p>I realized that I had a problem. I was doing the constant yo-yo of getting organized moving my life forward for a couple weeks and then finding myself overwhelmed again. I feel that it's because I couldn't trust that everything in OmniFocus was something that I should be working on. I would have 20 plus items available for one day and those items would be individual actions or projects.</p>
<p>I would procrastinate and think 'I'll just do this later' because the deadlines and defer dates where just useless pieces of data. Later I would kick myself because I spent hours surfing the internet instead of marking something off.</p>
<p>I needed to become more aware of what I was doing.</p>
<h3 id="time-budgeting-at-home">Time Budgeting at home</h3>
<p>Just like in financial budgeting, I needed to have more of an idea of where my time was going. I started using the app <a href="https://timingapp.com">Timing</a> to see how much time I spent goofing off versus actively using my computer<sup id="fnref:computer"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:computer">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img alt="A look at computer usage on my laptop for last week." src="/images/timing-week-in-july-2018.png"></p>
<p>Some of this, I already wrote about in a previous post, but I wanted to re-iterate how this is a continued reminder of how I keep myself on task.</p>
<p>There was a couple pitfalls with the process as my computing life is divided between a MacBook Pro and an iMac, but I'm hoping to clear some of that up with the new <a href="https://timingapp.com/blog/introducing-timing-sync/">timing sync</a> feature that was introduced.</p>
<h3 id="new-screentime-for-ios">New Screentime for iOS</h3>
<p><img alt="Screentime on iOS allows me to be mindful on the phone." src="/images/Screentime-early-July-2018.jpeg"></p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-12-preview/" title="A preview of the upcoming release.">new version of iOS,</a> I’m able to get a better idea of what I’m using my phone for on a daily and weekly basis. </p>
<p>Currently, I’m not using the App limits because I’m hoping that being aware of how I use my phone will prompt me to change my habits and increase my will power. </p>
<p><img alt="Show a light day of usage via ScreenTime" src="images/screentime.gif"></p>
<p>It’s definitely a great start to quantifying what areas I want to work on. There is still one more tool. </p>
<h3 id="streaks">Streaks</h3>
<p><a href="http://streaksapp.com">Streaks</a> is an App on iOS that I picked up one day shortly after New Year’s Day. I’ve been using it off and on for making sure that I mediate<sup id="fnref:break"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:break">3</a></sup> and write in my journal. </p>
<p>It wasn’t until recently that I made reviewing my projects a priority to review in Streaks and I feel that it has really made a difference<sup id="fnref:due"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:due">2</a></sup>. I get two kinds of positive reinforcements when I do this. The first, the fact that I get to mark it off. The second, I get to see evidence of my changing habit as a number. </p>
<h3 id="end-result">End result</h3>
<p>I feel better about myself as a responsible adult. There is true freedom in knowing what you are and are <em>not</em> doing. </p>
<p>I understand that this is a just a process for me and there is a possibility of me back sliding into bad habits. That is ok, because I know that getting back in the good habits is easier than ever before. </p>

<p>In my <a href="/2018/06/blog-accomplishments.html" title="Blog Accomplishments «Mandaris Moore»">last post</a>, I left off with a list of things that I wanted to work on for the next release of the design of the blog. I'm still changing the header at the top of the page and I've been working on improving the contrast of the colors you see for links to make it easier to read. Something you can't spot just by looking is the fact that <code>&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h3&gt;</code> tags don't correspond to the breakdown of the syntax of the rest of the site.</p>
<p><img alt="A small sample of the code that was being generated." src="images/sample-of-previous-syntax.png" title="Generated HTML in Sublime looks cool!"></p>
<h3 id="what-do-i-see-on-the-internet">What do I see on the internet</h3>
<p>I feel that a lot of the sites that are on the internet only use the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> tags and looking at some of the templates that I've come across for pelican use css classes to differentiate them in the design. </p>
<p>I don't have a problem with that, but I felt that it doesn't help those that might be using some kind of screen reader or parsing system<sup id="fnref:seo"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:seo">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="searching-for-a-solution">Searching for a solution</h3>
<p>Once again, I started looking for a place where this had already been fixed and quickly found one that would make sure that the html that <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html">python-markdown</a> would give me would match what I was expecting to give to my <a href="https://github.com/mandaris/modest" title="A very simple template for pelican">template</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cprieto">Christian Prieto</a> had already come up with this <a href="https://github.com/cprieto/mdx_downheader" title="Python Markdown Down Header Extension">handy solution</a> in 2016 and had put some tests and an example of how to incorporate it into pelican.</p>
<h3 id="but-there-are-further-complications">But there are further complications</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, pelican has changed since the original and I wasn't able to get the solution to work. The readme says to add the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">MD_EXTENSIONS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;downheader&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But the latest documentation found <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/settings.html" title="Pelican Settings">here</a>, have the markdown default to be defined as a dictionary and not an array<sup id="fnref:doc"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:doc">2</a></sup>. The simplest way to get it to work is to change your <code>pelicanconfig.py</code> to have the following code.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Markdown Plugins</span>
<span class="n">MARKDOWN</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;extension_configs&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.codehilite&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;css_class&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;highlight&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.extra&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.meta&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
<span class="hll">        <span class="s1">&#39;downheader&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
</span>    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;output_format&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;html5&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For me, I had to specify a value because the title of my site is in a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag and the article headers are in <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Markdown Plugins</span>
<span class="n">MARKDOWN</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;extension_configs&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.codehilite&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;css_class&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;highlight&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.extra&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.meta&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>

    <span class="s1">&#39;output_format&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;html5&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I've since made a <a href="https://github.com/cprieto/mdx_downheader/pull/5">pull request</a> so that others can get around this as well.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I'm happier and happier with the way that the site is coming together, but I'm afraid of the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a> that the site is accruing as I go along. I've to to make the readme a priority for those who come after me and want to make this design better.</p>
<p>I've also taken some time to just take the header and just make a <a href="https://github.com/mandaris/pelican-headers">standalone project</a> that demonstrates how it works. I points to the <code>simple</code> theme that comes with pelican so people can just download it after installing pelican, python-markdown and the mdx_downheader package.</p>

<p>This isn't the only place that has this, but I've been having trouble just getting the projects that I am using up to date.
