</header><p>The power went out this morning and left the house in darkness except for my laptop. I took this time to get some work done with my plugin for <a href="http://www.getpelican.com">Pelican</a> but I found myself at a stand still because I wanted to get some information on how regular expressions parse results into a dictionary.</p>
<p>With the internet not working, I decided that I'd try seeing what is available with the REPL in python and I found it to be fairly helpful in the fact that I had access to the documentation in the same interface as the code that I was writing.</p>
<p>In my case, I wanted to find out what methods are part of the match class. Sure, I ran into a minor bump of not knowing how to get help to show me the documentation of match directory, but I quickly got around that by run help on the match object that I created.</p>
<p><img alt="Exploring python in the terminal" src="../../images/Exploring_Python_in_terminal.png" /></p>
<p>Honestly, this gives me a little more confidence in myself that I can find things out on my own without having to turn to the internet and finding myself getting side tracked by all the destractions that someone can find. </p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

</header><p>My personal blog hasn't been changed in over a year. I've been waiting for that perfect moment when it would be ready for the world. Unfortunately, it's been stifled because of my own drive for it to be perfect before it sees the world.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't think anyone reads it and it's not going to get better unless I put some time into it.</p>
<p>But before I put any more effort into it, I want to take some time and write about why I should keep it in the first place.</p>
<h1>Web Technology is cool</h1>
<p>I like working on the web. Until this point, I never thought that I'd be considering a career where I'd be working on the web, but I've spent a lot of my life working or playing with something that is some how web related.</p>
<h2>Play around with different tech</h2>
<p>At the bare minimum, having a website allows you to play around with what can happen on the inter-webs and make that part of what people find when they google, bing or duck-duck-go your name.</p>
<h1>My Part of the web</h1>
<p>Ultimately, having your own website is about control. I control the content and what it looks like and if I choose. I can shut it down.</p>
<h2>Vanity</h2>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>All Me.</p>
<h2>Provide a Place to Share My Opinion</h2>
<p>I don't say much, but I know that this is the perfect platform because I choose to write here and I don't have to worry too much about saying "the wrong thing."</p>

</header><p>When I saw this in the app store, I thought this was an alright game. It had a fairly high rating, but I think that the developers must have gamed the rating system because anyone who has gotten passed the initial tutorial would be quickly bored by the tedious amount of grinding and the amount of in-app purchases that you get hammered with every time you want to do something.</p>
<p>The game has two different kinds of currency: One that proves pointless after 20 minutes and a true currency that you can only get by paying with real money. </p>
<p>Listen, if you're looking for a game that you only play once a day without paying $2-3, then this is it.</p>

</header><p>I've had a little idea going on in the back of my head for the last couple of months about a simple application that would pop up after a given keyboard shortcut. It's a simple idea and never got around to doing it because I didn't sit down and do it. Even on the days, where I thought "Hey,If I had an easy way to keep track of all the good things that I've done, I'd feel better about myself". Normally, I just look at the todo item that I had in OmniFocus and just push it back a couple days or weeks because of priorities.</p>
<p>But today, I sat down and decided that if I wanted to really follow my own words about controlling my life I've got to make good on the commitments that I make to myself big or small. </p>
<p>So I sat down behind my laptop opened up my AppleScript 1-2-3<sup id="fnref:unused"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:unused" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and started searching the internet after not seeing a solution to my problems on the first page.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nv">theSumm</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="na">text returned</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">display dialog</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Latest Accomplishment&quot;</span> <span class="nb">buttons</span> <span class="s2">&quot;OK&quot;</span> <span class="nv">default</span> <span class="nv">answer</span> <span class="s2">&quot;A step forward&quot;</span> <span class="nv">default</span> <span class="nb">button</span> <span class="s2">&quot;OK&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">tell</span> <span class="nb">application</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Calendar&quot;</span>
    <span class="nb">make</span> <span class="nv">todo</span> <span class="nb">at</span> <span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nv">todos</span> <span class="k">of</span> <span class="nv">calendar</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Accomplishments&quot;</span> <span class="nv">with</span> <span class="na">properties</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nv">summary</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nv">theSumm</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">completion</span> <span class="nv">date</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">current date</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">end</span> <span class="k">tell</span>
</pre></div>


<p>At first, I was just going to put this in a script file and then run it from a service, but I decided that the easiest way of doing this was to use <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/" title="An app that I've been using more and more to get things moving quickly.">Keyboard Maestro</a>. It was really cool that I got to move the entire script into the application so I didn't have to move between the different applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mandaris/10540756656/" title="A screenshot of my first keyboard maestro attempt to make a short cut to log my accomplishments"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3783/10540756656_0d7bd92af3.jpg" width="427" height="500" alt="A copy of my first keyboard maestro attempt to make a short cut to log my accomplishments"></a></p>
<p>This is what I had originally envisioned, but I started to think about the limitations of keeping all of this in reminders. All the applications that use the system built <a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/apps/#reminders" title="The default todo application on Mac OSX">task management tools</a> have a focus on what needs to be done and if I want to have way to look at this stuff quickly and I wasn't sure how to look at accomplishments that were marked as completed a month ago.</p>
<p>I took a look at what I was doing on a daily basis and saw that I've been doing more and more journaling using <a href="http://dayoneapp.com" title="Day One is a great simple application that allows you to have a journal that syncs with all my devices">Day One</a><sup id="fnref:dayoneshortcut"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dayoneshortcut" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. </p>
<p>I didn't want to make the Day One application open up every time that I finished something new so I looked at the <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/tools/cli-man/" title="Day One command line interface">command line interface</a> and came up with this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mandaris/10543020504/" title="Screenshot of my keyboard maestro macro to log accomplishments quickly using the command line interface for Day One"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5487/10543020504_5edfa7b7ba.jpg" width="387" height="500" alt="Screenshot of my keyboard maestro macro to log accomplishments quickly using the command line interface for Day One"></a></p>
<p>So far, the only downside is that I have to go into Day One to make all the hashtags turn into tags and I have to do a search for that tag if I want to see all my accomplishments in a given time.</p>
<p>I think for the next iteration, I might set up <a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/" title="GeekTool: A tool to show information from files and commands on the desktop">GeekTool</a> to show my latest accomplishment on my desktop, but I'm just happy that I finished this initial task.</p>

</header><p>Honestly, a lot of people that I respect are talking about it. I think I'm going to have to step through the tutorial again. But honestly, I'd like to think about what I want to do with it. </p>
<p>I already have a couple text editors but I love messing around with the tools more than doing the job sometimes. </p>
<p>The only reason that I don't use sublime text is because of the price. The "free" demo allows you to use it as long as you want but you see a pop up reminding you that it hasn't been purchased yet. I'm not at a point where I can justify the price and being someone who works in the industry, I want to encourage people to pay for software.</p>
<p>I've talked to some other people and it seems like they are proud of the being able to mentally blockout the popup and dismiss it without missing a beat.</p>
<p>To me, that just seems wrong on so many levels.</p>
