<p>I found a desk near the garbage bin and I wanted even though I didn't have room for it. I guess it's because I still love the idea of sitting down and getting to work on something. </p>
<p><img alt="A lone desk looking for a good home." src="images/garbage-desk.png"></p>
<p>I feel that it’s party because of the restlessness I get every once in a while where I want to make or learn something. I think I’m really making progress in keeping my eye on the ball and making sure to reflect on my goals. </p>
<h4 id="meanwhile">Meanwhile...</h4>
<p>Work has been really busy and weird at the same time. A lot of unanswered questions and unease just below the surface. I hope there isn’t any extra drama...</p>

<p>I started working before I made it into the office. It started with a text message asking if I had started a server after patching the day before. </p>
<p>I had. </p>
<p>I sent an email to everyone. </p>
<p>But something made me wonder. </p>
<p>Something was wrong. </p>
<p>Sure enough, the server had come up but it wasn’t working correctly. The account used for database connections was expired. I don’t know how long but it did. Honestly, I don’t even know if the system was being used and the patching was just an opportunity for others to get in the environment and see what was broken. </p>
<p>Lots of anxiety and just a feeling of helplessness as I had been the one to last touch the box. </p>
<p>Which just ran into another problem with another system just not running correctly. </p>
<p>Today, wasn’t a great day </p>

<p>I've almost finished the probation period at my new job and I've got to say that it feels good to have made it this far. I work hard and I think the people around me see that and want me to suceed just as much as I do.</p>
<p>Still, it wasn't always fun because of the learning curve and... well... the people.</p>
<p>I consider myself a people person in a lot of respects. It really isn't natural for me because I had no understanding of tact back in jr. high school seeing as most of my interactions were with books and movies. I was picked on quite a lot and it wasn't until college that I started to really grow as a person.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, and I'm seeing other people who are still growing as people. Some more mature and some not as much. Everyone has there own motivations.</p>

<p>This morning, I woke up to vomit.</p>
<p>After a very long night filled with little ones who don't like sleeping in their own beds by themselves coming to invade mommy and daddy's bed, I was awakened to a desperate plea for water. </p>
<p>I ran to get the water, she took two sips and then promptly threw up...</p>
<p>... in the bed</p>
<p>... on the way to bathroom</p>
<p>... not in the bathroom</p>
<p>... but on the way out</p>
<p>Luckily, my wife was able to take care of her during the day. So that I could go to work and train my replacement some more. </p>
<h4 id="oh-the-horrors">Oh, the horrors</h4>
<p>For the last year, I've been busy at work attempting to get an automated tool to work as it was designed. In fact, at one point I was attempting to automate the automated tool so that everyone could benefit by not running it. Personally, I thought this was a pointless endevour. </p>
<p>What is the point of automating an automated tool? Especially when that first tool is being modified and changed on an almost daily basis.</p>
<p>Well, I managed to get the system somewhat working but I found myself having to do a significant amount of working trying to fix other issues and it kind of died.</p>
<p>But the problems still persist. I welcome automation, but I have to question the logic when were are stacking issues upon issues like this.</p>
<h4 id="improvements-in-writing">Improvements in writing</h4>
<p>I've been doing this 250 word thing for almost 3 weeks now and I haven't done any editing on entries that I make. The original goal of this project was to get my thoughts out of my head and have something to look at as an achievement. I'm currently debating on whether I should read them because the process might make me too self conscience to write more.</p>
