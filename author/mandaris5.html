      Blog Accomplishments

  </h2>
</header><div class="e-content post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I think I'm ready to mark my second pelican theme 1.0 as "Feature Complete" today! I started off with -what I thought- a simple premise of having a site site took a lot longer than I expected but I'm pretty happy with the site for now.  But before I tag it and start working on 2.0, I want to go over what I've done so far.</p>
<p><img alt="Visualization of what I've accomplished with the blog." src="/images/blog-accomplishments.png"> </p>
<h3 id="parsable">Parsable</h3>
<p>The first thing I started researching was how to make the site parsable by webcrawlers. Although it's a personal blog, I wanted people to be able to find the content easily.</p>
<h4 id="opengraph">OpenGraph</h4>
<p>OpenGraph was the first thing that I came across and appealed to me the most because it's the preferred way of parsing data for Twitter<sup id="fnref:twitter"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:twitter">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I found it especially rewarding that the tags are also parsed by facebook and my new favorite social network <a href="https://slack.com">slack</a>. </p>
<p>One of the technical difficulties that I ran into when adding OpenGraph tags was adding the images. The specification for OpenGraph states that images to be used need to be added as meta data in the head of the html. This can be a pain as the other data like title and date can be pulled from the article itself and I didn't want to go through all my old posts to add image meta data.</p>
<p>Luckily, the  github user WhiskyEchoBravo had a <a href="https://github.com/whiskyechobravo/pelican-open_graph">project that searched the content of the post for images</a> and added the first to the list of tags. I'm a little proud that I helped with issues with <a href="https://github.com/whiskyechobravo/pelican-open_graph/commit/61248d805588245a9fc1dc4eda56cff1f5a9d8fa">pages</a>. </p>
<p>Afterwards, I did run into some frustration when the images that I added to posts wouldn't be as big as I expected.</p>
<p><img alt="Post in slack with a small image." src="images/slack-small-image.png"></p>
<p>Ultimately, I think it's because of the mixing and matching of having OpenGraph and twitter specific tags and was solved it by making sure I used the following for my twitter card.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">meta</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;twitter:card&quot;</span> <span class="na">content</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;summary_large_image&quot;</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now I get the post to unfurl nicely.</p>
<p><img alt="Post in slack with a large image." src="images/slack-large-image.png"></p>
<h4 id="schemaorg">Schema.org</h4>
<p>This is the styling used by both Bing and Google. I put this in as a challenge to myself to make it work in both instances. I leaned a lot from the example on <a href="https://orbitingweb.com/blog/schema-org-microdata-guide/" title="Complete Schema.Org and Microdata Tutorial for beginners">OrbitingWeb</a> and refined what I was working with using <a href="https://github.com/philwareham/schema-microdata-examples/blob/master/blog.html" title="Schema.org microdata examples">another example</a> that I found on github.</p>
<h3 id="valid-semantic-tags">Valid Semantic Tags</h3>
<p>For this, I just wanted to use some of those really cool semantic tags that html5 has given to us. When I look at the code for some pages on the internet I see a lot of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags with classes that could be replaced with <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,  or <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags.</p>
<p>I'm willing to just attribute it to my desire to have my own style or maybe just inexperience, but I'm happy to report that the site passes html validation except for the OpenGraph definitions found in the header.</p>
<h4 id="figure-it-out">figure it out</h4>
<p>One technical hurdle I ran into was that I wanted my images to be wrapped in the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tag and also have a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tag that would have the alternative text. </p>
<p>I searched for a plugin for pelican<sup id="fnref:figure-ref"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:figure-ref">2</a></sup>, but the closest thing I could find was <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/liquid_tags">liquid tags</a> at the time<sup id="fnref:liquid"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:liquid">3</a></sup>.  </p>
<p>I did find jdittrich <a href="https://github.com/jdittrich/figureAltCaption">figureAltCaption</a> project on github which was a extension for the <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/">python-markdown</a>  that pelican uses. I even submitted a <a href="https://github.com/jdittrich/figureAltCaption/pull/3" title="Still wait to be pulled into the main branch">pull request</a>  to allow it to do reference links!</p>
<p>There was a little confusion on getting it to work because pelican has been changing since some of these plugins were created.</p>
<p>Long story short, I had to add the following to my <code>pelicanconfig.py</code> to get it to work.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>   <span class="c1"># Markdown Plugins</span>
<span class="n">MARKDOWN</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;extension_configs&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.codehilite&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;css_class&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;highlight&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.extra&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.meta&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
<span class="hll">        <span class="s1">&#39;figureAltCaption&#39;</span><span class="p">:{},</span>
</span>    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;output_format&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;html5&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="easy-to-share">Easy to share</h3>
<p>I wrote down that I wanted the site to be easy to share and it is when you look at the amount of tags and metadata that is in every page. </p>
<p>At one point, I wanted to add share buttons, but -with the rise in concerns about privacy- I wanted the users of the site to be the ones who would share it.</p>
<p>Also, I'm still working on color schemes so the buttons might clash with whatever I end up with.</p>
<p><img alt="Clash of the social buttons!" src="images/supported-social-networks.jpg" title="The number of ways to share an article is too dang high!"></p>
<h3 id="accessible">Accessible</h3>
<p>One of the underlining principles of this site design is that I wanted it to be accessible to as many people as possible. It's part of the reason that I've worked so hard on making sure that I included so many semantic tags. I didn't think that this was particularly hard to do when you understand what needs to happen before you begin. </p>
<p>The theme doesn't have any errors at this point, but does loose some points because of the way that markdown headers are handled and the fact that I picked a low contrast color for my links. I'll fix it soon.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-and-where-im-going-next">Conclusion and where I'm going next</h3>
<p>Overall, I'm happy with this version of the site and blogging about it has helped me think about what places I want to refine going forward. </p>
<h4 id="list-of-things-to-improve">List of things to improve</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a decent readme with all the packages and properties that the theme uses</li>
<li>Improve color contrast for reading</li>
<li>Add Cristian Prieto's <a href="https://github.com/cprieto/mdx_downheader">mdx_downheader</a></li>
<li>Make the top navigation a little less clunky</li>
<li>Look into how to integrate micro.blog posts</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Looking back there were 4 main areas. Performance being the first." src="images/WWDC-2018.png"></p>
<p>My first feeling about the keynote is genuine happiness. I'm happy that they are going to focus on the performance of the operating system. I'm happy that they are supporting all the devices that were working with iOS 11. I'm also happy that they are <strong>NOT</strong> introducing a lot of extraneous<sup id="fnref:extra"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:extra">1</a></sup> features that people may never use.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-performance">Focus on performance</h3>
<p>I'm tired of people having problems with Apple devices. I'm the family tech support and I do <em>not</em> like the feeling of having someone's device not work. This is compounded when I'm usually the one who recommends them. </p>
<p>I'm hoping that this will allow me to not have to answer as many questions and make the current devices last longer. I can't afford to buy anything new at this point.</p>
<h3 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h3>
<p>I am already on board the automation train. I've got the <a href="https://www.workflow.is">workflow</a> and <a href="https://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">launch center pro</a> applications on my phone. I feel that this should allow me and everyone else a better way of getting rid of repetitive tasks.</p>
<h3 id="bring-developers-back-to-the-mac-app-store">Bring developers back to the Mac App Store</h3>
<p>I'll believe it when I see it, but it definitely gives me the warm fuzzies to have developers feel more at ease on the platforms that I love.</p>
<h3 id="apple-watch">Apple Watch</h3>
<p>I think this is the best presentation that I've seen with Kevin Lynch. I would like an Apple watch, but I have trouble thinking about how I'd incorporate it into my life. When I saw those demos along with everything else associated with iOS 12, I found myself dreaming about owning one again<sup id="fnref:again"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:again">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All in all, I'm happy with the keynote and actually a little sad that people weren't. It really feels like Apple is sitting down and letting their products mature a little more as they move forward.</p>

<p>I guess it shows that you never know what you can do until you try.</p>
<p>The only thing that I regret is that I went down the rabit hole and spent almost an hour this morning researching formats and dimensions for making my icon <em>perfect</em>. </p>

<p>A long time ago, I went to a seminar called EmpowerU. Don't bother looking them up because the name has been used by so many different organizations, it would just confuse you to what I'm trying to say...</p>
<p><em>Anyway,</em> I went to a seminar and I really got inspired to make a change in my life and I've been struggling with trying to make sense of where I want to go next.</p>
<p>It feels like all I can think about it just trying to make it to the next week or day. </p>
<p>But that's not thriving, and that's not the example that I want to show my children.</p>
<p>How do I get out of this rut?</p>
