</header><p>I had trouble coming up with something to make today. I usually set up a time to do something right after work, but found myself staring at my phone for 15 minutes thinking about how I couldn't think of anything<sup id="fnref:crossyroad"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:crossyroad" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I spent so time dabbling with CrazyTalk Animator, but didn't want to spend the time customizing a character today. I noticed that there were some properties that I couldn't change using the version that I have on my laptop<sup id="fnref:cost"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:cost" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So, I think what I will do other than make this post is to commit myself to crafting a video on how to do certain exercises using swift. It would mark off a couple of things that I've been wanting to produce and allow me to have a road map going forward. Not just sitting down and thinking "what am I going to make today".</p>

</header><p>Today, I thought I'd document something simple like how I created an alias to render the blog and then port it to my website. I'm writing it out in hopes that something will pop up and say "There is an easier way of doing it!"</p>
<p>The first thing I do for most posts is I open up Byword to write the words that you are seeing before you. If it's something a little more complicated, I might start off in MindNode<sup id="fnref:MindNode"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:MindNode" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and export to Markdown. </p>
<p>I use a TextExpander snippet to set the header and then just start writing and save the file in dropbox.</p>
<p><img alt="The popup window for the TextExpander header for my website." src="../../images/textexpander_window_header_for_post.png" /></p>
<p>The part that I feel needs improvement is finishing the draft. I have a virtual environment set up for pelican that has all the templates and plugins that I've been tweaking to make the site look and behave in the way that I want. This means that any extra syntax or themes don't show up unless I process the markdown<sup id="fnref:marked"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:marked" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To solve this, I've set up a hazel rule<sup id="fnref:rule"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rule" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> to copy over all the files. </p>
<p><img alt="Hazel rule to clone over all the posts and images for the blog" src="../../images/hazel_rule_to_clone_posts.png" /></p>
<p>After that, I can run a local server to see what the post looks like after being processed.</p>
<p><img alt="An iTerm window with the commands that I use to run the development server" src="../../images/running_local_server.png" /></p>
<p>Which leads us to the thing that I created. An alias in my environment to rsync the finished website and push it to github to host.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>alias pub=&quot;pelican; rsync -r /Users/mandaris/Projects/quotidian/output/* ~/Projects/mandaris.github.com&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Well, that was a longer explanation that I was thinking it would be. </p>

<p>To be honest, this hasn't been working like I want it to. I have to manually run the rule. I'll make it a OmniFocus project to get the rules to work properly.

</header><p>I think this is it. This is what the Apple App Store should look and feel like going forward. It's easy to install with all the possible apps just living in a folder until you double click to install.</p>
<p><img alt="The Setapp menue looks like a regular folder of application. They are really just small applications that show a preview of what the app is." src="../../images/setapp_selection.png" /></p>
<p>Honestly, I don't know how to put it into words because it was so, so simple and it had all the little applications that I wanted but couldn't bring myself to buy because of the price[^budge].</p>
<p><img alt="A preview of the TaskPaper app in Setapp" src="../../images/setapp_application_preview.png" /></p>
<p>The super sad part about this is that I've taken on a new job where I have to use Windows all day. When I get home, it's family time. Coupled with that is this would be another subscription that I have to keep track of.</p>
<p>For the developers, I hope this works out that they get the money they deserve from all of those people who are sitting on the side lines. </p>

</header><p>I'm lucky enough to have an imac. Unfortantely, I've been having some trouble keeping space free on the machine. So, I took some time to check it how much disk space that I had left when I saw this!</p>
<p><img alt="Disk Utility in macOS Sierra showing only disk usage, purgable data and free space." src="/images/disk_utility_macos_sierra.png" title="Disk Utility in macOS Sierra" /></p>
<p>Yes, it does show me that I have some free space, but it doesn't give me anything related to how much of that data I could get rid of or revaluate. One my laptop, I'm still running El Capitan and it gives me a really nice overview<sup id="fnref:previously"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:previously" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img alt="Disk Utility in macOS El Capitan showing disk usage of apps, photos, audio, movies and more as well as free space." src="/images/disk_utility_macos_el_capitan.png" title="Disk Utility in macOS El Capitan" /></p>
<p>I guess this is connected to Apple's new push to have people store their information in the crowd; maybe illustrated how much purgable spaces was in each individual category would have been too complicated.</p>
<p>Still, I miss the old view...</p>

</header><p>So this post is more of a follow up to explain my logic for what I'm doing. Sometimes, it's just good to write out your thoughts.</p>
<p><figure><figcaption>I find myself putting more and more of my thoughts into mindmaps. I will have to come up with a way to put them into better drafts.</figcaption><img src="../../images/Create_something_everyday.png"/></figure></p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>What would making something every day do for me?  That was the question that I asked myself. I've been missing something for months if not years and it was the satisfaction that I was creating something meaningful outside of being a parent. I was feeling helpless and I was slowly seeing things not getting done. </p>
<p>I was losing control.</p>
<p>I feel that this will allow me a jump start into taking some control. </p>
<p>As opposed to learning to control my body via exercise and meditation<sup id="fnref:meditation"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:meditation" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>What Counts</h2>
<p>The last two are things that I've never made before and I'd like to make it part of my challenge to get something in front of other people. Honestly, I don't know how many people read my blog anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog Entries</li>
<li>Tutorials</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Examples</li>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Vlog</li>
</ul>
<h2>What doesn’t count</h2>
<p>These are things that I was doing anyway and I don't want to make it part of the challenge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Journal Entries</li>
<li>Tweets</li>
</ul>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:meditation">
<p>I'm also doing those things as well, but I'm not going to focus on those changes.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:meditation" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

</header><p>The first thing that I'd like to work on is getting the article header that I'm using to be more capable of handing meta data for individual entries. Currently, it points to the specific url for the article but I'd like it to take my current header.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">title</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Where</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">put</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">maybe</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">someday</span>

<p>and add the <code>link</code> attribute</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">title</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Where</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">put</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">maybe</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">someday</span>

<span class="n">link</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">some_other_place</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">com</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I started off with the following jinja heading.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">&lt;h1&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;a rel=&quot;bookmark&quot;</span>
<span class="x">   href=&quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.url</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot;</span>

<span class="x">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To be honest, I don't do development on the blog that often so I used my own code to look up how to do an <code>if</code> statement in jinja and wrote a little test line to see if it worked.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.title</span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">article.link</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.link</span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">endif</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
</pre></div>


<p>After editing the page a number of times and doing more research that I should have into which kind of <code>rel</code> tag I should use for book marks versus external links, I finished up with this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nv">article.link</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;a rel=&quot;external&quot;</span>
<span class="x">   title=&quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.title</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="nf">striptags</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"> «</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">SITENAME</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">»&quot;</span>
<span class="x">   href=&quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.link</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot;&gt;</span>
<span class="x">   </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.title</span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">{%</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="cp">%}</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x">&lt;a rel=&quot;bookmark&quot;</span>
<span class="x">   title=&quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.title</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="nf">striptags</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"> «</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">SITENAME</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">»&quot;</span>
<span class="x">   href=&quot;</span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.url</span> <span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x">&quot;&gt;</span>
<span class="x">   </span><span class="cp">{{</span> <span class="nv">article.title</span><span class="cp">}}</span><span class="x"></span>
