</header><p>I’ve thought about it. The desires of my life. About what I would I would do if I could do it in an instant. What would I do if I were to snap my fingers and the thing that I wanted were to magically happen; whether it was instantly get into shape or finish that book.</p>
<p>It is in these moments of clarity that I come closer to the reality that if I want to realize these hopes and dreams that I must first start towards them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A journey of a thousand miles began with a single step.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, I’m not going to beat myself up about the steps I haven’t taken. There isn’t any point in doing that. </p>
<p>I’m not going to freak out about what tools to use or what direction to go in.</p>
<p>I’m going to sit here, not afraid of what obstacles and hurdles I may run into or worry that I’m going the wrong way.</p>
<p>I’m going to take this moment and be thankful for the opportunities that I have in front of me.</p>
<p>I’m alive and in good health. </p>
<p>I have a family downstairs reading to each other and living in the moment created by the universe just for them.</p>
<p>When I finish this little piece of writing, I’m going down to be with them knowing that although I have millions and millions of possibilities for things to do, I only have so many moments to be with them.</p>
<p>And that is a kind of peace of mind that money or dreams can’t buy.</p>
