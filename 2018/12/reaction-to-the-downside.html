<p>I've been listening to <a href="https://coreint.org" title="A podcast about indie software development for the Mac, iOS and other Apple technologies.">Core Intuition</a> for years, because it was great to hear how independent developers go about making a living. When I'm sweating to make a living by working on someone else's schedule, I'd listen to how they are making ends meet while still enjoying life. I might not always agree with what they were saying but something about how they viewed themselves and their business gave me hope that you could follow your passions in life.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://coreint.org/2018/11/episode-351-heres-the-downside/">Episode 351: Here's The Downside</a>, Daniel talked about how his application, <a href="https://red-sweater.com/marsedit/" title="Write, preview, publish, and archive your blog from a Mac.">MarsEdit</a>, wasn't making as much money as he hoped. </p>
<p>It shook me.</p>
<p>I had been hearing for years how many developers were having the same problems. In my mind, I thought that this was a great product that should be seen as a great reason to use the Mac.</p>
<p>I've identified myself with Daniel many times over the years and want him to succeed. To be the little guy who is making it.</p>
<p>I haven't finished the episode.</p>
<p>I'm afraid to.</p>
<p>For some reason, I feel that if I don't finish it. It won't be as bad as what the worst case scenario could be.</p>
