<p>I've been using streaks and the fact that I've been feeling a little lost to start journalling a little more seriously recently. Things are falling apart in little ways here and there. </p>
<p>It feels like my wife and I are definitely on different pages and stuck in a rut as it were.</p>
<p>Our home has problems with mold again.</p>
<p>Our youngest is having trouble walking.</p>
<p>And we have to face the possibility that we won't be able to move up to better housing at the end of October.</p>
<p>Very stressful.</p>
<p>One of the few things that I have control over is my time journalling and how I approach this problem.</p>
<p>I don't want to feel too overwhelmed.</p>

<p>One of my co-workers is Catholic and was going to give up his daily routine of drinking a <a href="https://us.coca-cola.com/coke-zero-sugar/" title="Enjoy the real taste of Coca-Cola in a zero calorie, sugar free beverage.

<p>I wasn't thinking...</p>
<p>I decided to give up <strong>BOTH</strong> BBQ sauce and comics.</p>
<p>I've been fiending for both since that moment. </p>
<p>In fact, I woke up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Wednesday" title="Ash Wednesday is a Christian holy day of prayer and fasting.">Ash Wednesday</a> fiending for something smoothered in sauce.</p>
<p>For comics, I've even stopped myself from watching anything that is animated because I think of it as a moving comic.</p>
<p>It's been hard to relax, but it has made me look into other sauces and I'm doing a lot more work around the house.</p>

<p>I really like that my children are going to see a Science Fiction movie. When I was a kid there weren't a lot of heroes that looked like me. Sure, there were black super heroes. But they were usually some buff side kick or characature; mostly muscle and charisma. </p>
<p>I like the fact that they are showing women in movies that are more than just a side character.</p>

<p>I've been listening to <a href="https://coreint.org" title="A podcast about indie software development for the Mac, iOS and other Apple technologies.">Core Intuition</a> for years, because it was great to hear how independent developers go about making a living. When I'm sweating to make a living by working on someone else's schedule, I'd listen to how they are making ends meet while still enjoying life. I might not always agree with what they were saying but something about how they viewed themselves and their business gave me hope that you could follow your passions in life.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://coreint.org/2018/11/episode-351-heres-the-downside/">Episode 351: Here's The Downside</a>, Daniel talked about how his application, <a href="https://red-sweater.com/marsedit/" title="Write, preview, publish, and archive your blog from a Mac.">MarsEdit</a>, wasn't making as much money as he hoped. </p>
<p>It shook me.</p>
<p>I had been hearing for years how many developers were having the same problems. In my mind, I thought that this was a great product that should be seen as a great reason to use the Mac.</p>
<p>I've identified myself with Daniel many times over the years and want him to succeed. To be the little guy who is making it.</p>
<p>I haven't finished the episode.</p>
<p>I'm afraid to.</p>
<p>For some reason, I feel that if I don't finish it. It won't be as bad as what the worst case scenario could be.</p>

<p>I'm about to do a review of what needs to be done this week and I'm hesitant to start. Although I've been getting better at making sure that things get done, the sheer amount of "stuff" can feel overwhelming if I look at all of it at once. </p>
<p>I think that is why I find myself drawn to OmniFocus and GTD in general. It give me a tool that allows me to trust that what I'm <em>not</em> doing is correct.</p>
<p>But back to the matter at hand, what should my next project be?</p>
<h3 id="moving-the-site-generation-to-another-server">Moving the site generation to another server</h3>
<p>Currently, I have a iMac at home that generates the site and then <code>scp</code> the files to a server. The only times that I have had an issue is when I had to shut down dropbox running on the machine because it was being a resource hog.</p>
<p>My plan is to move all of my posts to a repository and then having a cron job running on the server to do an update every hour to update the repository and then the website. </p>

      Productivity review

  </h2>

<p>Moving forward has gotten easier and easier to do. I'm definitely on an upswing when it comes to most of my goals for the last couple of months.</p>
<p>What am I attributing this new to this success?</p>
<p>More regular reviews via OmniFocus and a desire to accomplish what I set out to do.</p>
<p><img alt="A brief look at what I'm supposed to be doing today." src="/images/OmniFocus-today-July.jpeg"></p>
<p>For the longest time, I would have OmniFocus on my laptop and and iPhone and just wish that it would organize my life - that everything would just fall into place by some kind of magic. I think this is why productivity software will always be in demand. People want things to happen, but they forget that it's just a tool and if you don't change who you are or your approach to the problem nothing is going to happen.</p>
<h3 id="reflecting-in-what-needs-to-change">Reflecting in what needs to change</h3>
<p>I realized that I had a problem. I was doing the constant yo-yo of getting organized moving my life forward for a couple weeks and then finding myself overwhelmed again. I feel that it's because I couldn't trust that everything in OmniFocus was something that I should be working on. I would have 20 plus items available for one day and those items would be individual actions or projects.</p>
<p>I would procrastinate and think 'I'll just do this later' because the deadlines and defer dates where just useless pieces of data. Later I would kick myself because I spent hours surfing the internet instead of marking something off.</p>
<p>I needed to become more aware of what I was doing.</p>
<h3 id="time-budgeting-at-home">Time Budgeting at home</h3>
<p>Just like in financial budgeting, I needed to have more of an idea of where my time was going. I started using the app <a href="https://timingapp.com">Timing</a> to see how much time I spent goofing off versus actively using my computer<sup id="fnref:computer"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:computer">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img alt="A look at computer usage on my laptop for last week." src="/images/timing-week-in-july-2018.png"></p>
<p>Some of this, I already wrote about in a previous post, but I wanted to re-iterate how this is a continued reminder of how I keep myself on task.</p>
<p>There was a couple pitfalls with the process as my computing life is divided between a MacBook Pro and an iMac, but I'm hoping to clear some of that up with the new <a href="https://timingapp.com/blog/introducing-timing-sync/">timing sync</a> feature that was introduced.</p>
<h3 id="new-screentime-for-ios">New Screentime for iOS</h3>
<p><img alt="Screentime on iOS allows me to be mindful on the phone." src="/images/Screentime-early-July-2018.jpeg"></p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-12-preview/" title="A preview of the upcoming release.">new version of iOS,</a> I’m able to get a better idea of what I’m using my phone for on a daily and weekly basis. </p>
<p>Currently, I’m not using the App limits because I’m hoping that being aware of how I use my phone will prompt me to change my habits and increase my will power. </p>
<p><img alt="Show a light day of usage via ScreenTime" src="images/screentime.gif"></p>
<p>It’s definitely a great start to quantifying what areas I want to work on. There is still one more tool. </p>
<h3 id="streaks">Streaks</h3>
<p><a href="http://streaksapp.com">Streaks</a> is an App on iOS that I picked up one day shortly after New Year’s Day. I’ve been using it off and on for making sure that I mediate<sup id="fnref:break"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:break">3</a></sup> and write in my journal. </p>
<p>It wasn’t until recently that I made reviewing my projects a priority to review in Streaks and I feel that it has really made a difference<sup id="fnref:due"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:due">2</a></sup>. I get two kinds of positive reinforcements when I do this. The first, the fact that I get to mark it off. The second, I get to see evidence of my changing habit as a number. </p>
<h3 id="end-result">End result</h3>
<p>I feel better about myself as a responsible adult. There is true freedom in knowing what you are and are <em>not</em> doing. </p>
<p>I understand that this is a just a process for me and there is a possibility of me back sliding into bad habits. That is ok, because I know that getting back in the good habits is easier than ever before. </p>
