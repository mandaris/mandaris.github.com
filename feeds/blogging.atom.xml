At first, I was worried that it would filled with the standard novice information like how to get on the internet being taught by someone took 15 minutes to get some information off the internet and put it into a powerpoint presentation to read to use.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Hyde Doc suck</title><link href="http://quotidianquest.com/2012/01/hyde-doc-suck.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-01-25T10:41:34-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:quotidianquest.com,2012-01-25:2012/01/hyde-doc-suck.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently came across as &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hyde-dev/browse_thread/thread/db9213433190487f" title="Message post from Google Groups"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; from a goggle group that I'm part of that is centered around &lt;a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde" title="Hyde on GitHub"&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt; which is what I'm currently using to statically generate my website/blog. The email was basically asking "What's up with the docs?" and all I can do is just shake my head in agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that a significant amount of these open source projects are created by people whose talent is mostly with the creation of the tools and not with the associatated docs. This leaves a lot of people in the dust because people see the end result and want to have something cool like that, but don't have the time/desire to dive into the code and learn how it works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not because they are lazy, it because we are all busy people and sometimes we don't need to know every aspect of something to use it. For example, you don't have to be a mechanic to drive your car&lt;sup id="fnref:car"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:car" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I wish I could help this guy out because I've had similar problems with this and other projects and it can be daunting to stick your head out and ask the questions. But you have to have the &lt;a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/12/01/courageous-sucking" title="Photography, and the Tolerance for Courageous Sucking via 43folders"&gt;courage to suck&lt;/a&gt; in order to get any better at something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:car"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... but a little more knowledged in this area can save you a ton of money.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:car" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
