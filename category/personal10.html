<p>Today was another great day for dancing. I went to the lindy hop lesson again and I think I did pretty good on most of the drills except for the lindy circle and I rediscovered that I have a small issue where I pull a follow out of their anchor step. It's weird to be reminded that there is a little "and" before you start dancing. I met a couple good people during the dance and it was great meeting people who dance for the sheer enjoyment of it versus trying to meet people.</p>
<p>I think I've matured quite a bit because I didn't get stuck in my own head and compare myself against every other dancer including what I imagined what I was able to do during my "glory days". I just took it as a chance to have fun and work on my basic<sup id="fnref-basic_dance"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-basic_dance">1</a></sup>. </p>

<p>My daughter has a bug bite on her eye and it's swollen up pretty bad. Today, after I picked her up, she told me about how all the kids were asking about it. I don't know exactly how she felt, so I tried to let her know that she'll be alright and that the other kids just wanted to make sure that she was alright. Luckily, the eye is getting better.</p>

<p>Today, I stayed home with my oldest. She had woken up with a very pink and very swollen right eye. We didn't know if it was pink eye or something else so we had her stay home and then we took her to the doctor later in the morning. It was pretty nice spending time with her during the day because although the eye looked pretty bad, it didn't really hurt her too much.</p>
<p>She seemed to really enjoy the day that we had together and I even thought about taking her to work tomorrow if her eye doesn't get better. I think it would be nice for her to see where daddy works.</p>
<h4 id="playing-hooky">Playing Hooky</h4>
<p>Despite the fact that I'm not in the office, work still comes in. Normally, this isn't a problem because I would connect to all of my necessary machines remotely ad do the work without having to deal with lag. Things have changed because I've since given away those machines to the guy I'm training to replace me. File transfers are horrible and the performance of the machine is terribly slow when I'm attempting to make a video, run a test or just check my email.</p>
<h4 id="star-wars">Star Wars</h4>
<p>For the last week or so, I've been trying to get the girls to sit down and watch Star Wars with me. Apparently, they do not have the patience to learn about a galaxy far, far away... They ask to watch it, but 30 minutes into it they fall asleep or go off and play. </p>

<p>This morning, I woke up to vomit.</p>
<p>After a very long night filled with little ones who don't like sleeping in their own beds by themselves coming to invade mommy and daddy's bed, I was awakened to a desperate plea for water. </p>
<p>I ran to get the water, she took two sips and then promptly threw up...</p>
<p>... in the bed</p>
<p>... on the way to bathroom</p>
<p>... not in the bathroom</p>

<p>Luckily, my wife was able to take care of her during the day. So that I could go to work and train my replacement some more. </p>
<h4 id="oh-the-horrors">Oh, the horrors</h4>
<p>For the last year, I've been busy at work attempting to get an automated tool to work as it was designed. In fact, at one point I was attempting to automate the automated tool so that everyone could benefit by not running it. Personally, I thought this was a pointless endevour. </p>
<p>What is the point of automating an automated tool? Especially when that first tool is being modified and changed on an almost daily basis.</p>
<p>Well, I managed to get the system somewhat working but I found myself having to do a significant amount of working trying to fix other issues and it kind of died.</p>
<p>But the problems still persist. I welcome automation, but I have to question the logic when were are stacking issues upon issues like this.</p>
<h4 id="improvements-in-writing">Improvements in writing</h4>
<p>I've been doing this 250 word thing for almost 3 weeks now and I haven't done any editing on entries that I make. The original goal of this project was to get my thoughts out of my head and have something to look at as an achievement. I'm currently debating on whether I should read them because the process might make me too self conscience to write more.</p>

<p>Today was a great day. </p>
<p>Truly great.</p>
<p>The family went to funderland and had a wonderful time going on the little rides. It's at these times that I really realize that time isn't going to stand still. Already, some of the rides are too small for my oldest and I worry that the simple things in life won't be enough to entertain them. That doesn't mean they'll want to go bungie jumping next year, but it could certainly make things different if they would rather sit at home and play video games then spend some time at the park.</p>
<p>Recently, my oldest has been wanting to play the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cootie_(game)" title="Not the one where you pretend a the opposite sex is yucky, but I'll take that too!">Cooties</a> and it's been fun interacting with her. I think I've mentioned that I have trouble sometimes interacting with her and I want to spend as many chances as I can to let my children know who I am.</p>
<h4 id="dance-shape">Dance Shape</h4>
<p>My wife and I have made up after a couple days of quite rioting and we've both decided that I needed more ways of reducing stress. So, I'll be going dancing on a more regular basis <sup id="fnref-trial_basis"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-trial_basis">1</a></sup>. The thing about this is that I'm starting over. When I'm on the floor it feels like I've never danced before. All I can remember is how to keep my hands in the right spot (so I don't get slapped) and how to keep rhythm. </p>
<p>Every dance, I'm winded and I feel muscles that haven't been used in years burn with awakening. It hurts me physically, but my pride is swelling.</p>

      Cleaning up

  </h2>
</header><div class="e-content post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Recently, management for our complex sent out an email to all the residents that people should be cleaning up after their pets. What's the deal people? I think that if you decide to have a pet you must understand that you have a responsibility to not only feed and clean it but to clean up after it. Another thing that sucks is that I just got a dog so when I walk by my neighbors I get te stink eye because I'm going to be grouped up with the other dog owners who leave the little surprises everywhere. </p>
<h4 id="i-need-to-come-up-with-a-way-to-relax">I need to come up with a way to relax</h4>
<p>I was hoping that this journaling thing would help me relax, but since I made a commitment of writing 250 everyday, it can be difficult on some days to come up with something to write and the stress of trying to think of something in the last moment has been somewhat stressful.</p>
<p>With the last couple of weeks of employment come up, I've been increasingly stressed out about it and I think I'm transfering some of those negative emotions into my marriage. </p>
<p>Not good.</p>
<p>Not only is it not fair and will only cause more problems, but it does nothing to reduce the initial problem. </p>
<h4 id="dance-baby-dance">Dance, Baby, Dance!</h4>
<p>So it looks like, I've been given the OK to go dancing again next week by the wife. She's kind of the jeolous type, but -aparently- I've been so stressed that she'd rather have me go out and blow off some steam then have me brooding at home.</p>

<p>The wife had basically kicked me out and said that I needed some time alone and she wanted some time with the girls. Up until this point, we had been in a silent one sided argument over whether or not a certain someone should wear chapstick on their lips because it causes the other party to have a split lip. So I called up my friend, Nick, and made plans for tonight.</p>
<p>At first I was amprehensive. I haven't danced in years and I have a tendency to be very hard on myself and this sometimes gets compounded when I remember/imagine how good I used to be and look at where my skill level is now. But I got over myself and said that I was going to go enjoy myself and not critize myself too much.</p>
<p>I went to the dance lesson before hand and felt like I was starting off from scratch. This actually made me feel better because I could just concentrate on getting better and not think about how good it could have been.</p>
<h5 id="like-father-like-daughter">Like Father, Like Daughter</h5>
<p>One thing I noticed about me going out dancing is that I act like my daughter when the instructor is talking. I play around, make jokes and generally lose track of the specific counts for new moves. </p>
<p>And then I feel bad and correct myself too much. </p>
<p>And then I goof off again. I think it's alright because the people around me enjoy it. Sure, I don't learn that specific move very well at the time. But I feel the relaxed atmosphere makes  it easier to find the rhythem of the dance and make the total dance better than one or two moves.</p>

<p>Respect is very valuable to a relationship. When we decide to trust someone with our hearts there is a rule, either spoken or commonly understood, that the two people in the relationship will respect each other as human beings. Sometimes we forget, sometimes we take each other for granted, but if you continue to disrespect your partner, you're going to have some real problems.</p>
<h5 id="on-the-hunt">On the Hunt</h5>
<p>In other news, I'm wondering how all of this is going to pan out. Time is running out...</p>
<p>I've thought about what kind of goals I'd like to reach in the next couple of days and I think they are pretty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.M.A.R.T">S.M.A.R.T</a>.</p>
<h5 id="training-others">Training Others</h5>
<p>I'm still training my replacement at my current job and it has definitely been a unique experience for me. To me, I see this as more evidence of our disposable culture. My employer sees me as a tool that can easily be replaced. This flies in the face of my goal of being someone that doesn't need a rèsumè in order to get hired. </p>
<p>As far as the company is concerned, this is standard business practice. A way to cut cost by not paying benefits and then being able to let people go without any remorse. </p>
<p>Listen, if you don't like it. You don't have to work here.</p>
<h6 id="project-development">Project Development</h6>
<p>I'm kicking around a couple ideas at the moment and they will continue to be ideas for the foreseeable future due to some time contraints I'm under. I don't want to put anything here because that would be another commitment that I've got to think about. </p>
<p>I'll just add it to OmniFocus for now.</p>

<p>My wife's sister has just had a horrible experience attempting to get her car fixed. The problem all started when she had a car accident one night<sup id="fnref-car crash"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-car crash">1</a></sup> and the car was totaled. Others would have cut their loses then and there, but I think that because this was the first car that she bought with her own money she saw it as something worth saving<sup id="fnref-saving"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-saving">2</a></sup> and has literally spent enough money in repairs that she probably could have bought a new one.</p>
<p>I really feel sorry for her. The world does not have an easy way of telling us wether or not something is good deal and when it comes to mechanics, even if they are honest, it doesn't mean that they know what they are doing. I've run into my fair share of people who simply want to make the most money they can from you. I've heard people say that the price for anything is "what the customer can afford". </p>
<p>What are we doing to each other? It seemed like "Honest work for honest pay" is a forgotten concept in our ever consumer focused world.</p>

<p>Today, I met my replacement at work.</p>
<p>He's a lot older than I expected<sup id="fnref-expected"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-expected">1</a></sup> which got me worried. How bad is it out there to find a job?</p>
<p>But it also got me thinking about how our disposable culture. How is it even though everyone seemed to like me at work that I'm still facing a hard end date for leaving and finding something else. I was part of the team, a reliable rock that could get things moving...</p>
<p>But in a couple weeks, I'll be gone and that person I trained will be doing what I did for them. </p>
<p>Honestly, I don't blame the guy and <em>some</em> people have said that I should withhold some of the knowledged that I've accumulated along the way, but I won't do that because I don't need the bad karma and I'm not in the business of burning bridges. The guy is actually pretty nice and was quiet and just soaked up what I was telling him.</p>
<p>He generally liked my teaching style<sup id="fnref-teach"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-teach">2</a></sup> and we even had a great discussion about how development works. I spent a lot of time explaining things and it was nice to show someone all the little things that I have to do every day. I wish him the best, but I wish for better things going forward.</p>
