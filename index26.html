      How I use Email

<p>Recently, Mac Developer Brent Simmons discussed on his <a href="http://inessential.com/2010/01/16/email_init">blog</a> about the importance of a good email client. Although, he said he wouldn't spearhead the project, he did start up a mailing list (ironic) for it. The list has been going crazy with people going back and forth over what the ideal mail client was and what should be in the 1.0 release.</p>
<p>One of the posters, Matthieu Cormier, has posted on his <a href="http://www.preenandprune.com/cocoamondo/?p=795">blog</a> how he uses Mail.app and I thought it would be a good exercise to re-evaulate how I use mail and maybe that would help move the discussion along.<br>
<img alt="A diagram of my mail usage" src="email.png" title="Diagram of my mail usage"></p>
<p>Last year, I made the switch from .mac to gmail and it's been kind of interesting to see how Mail.app handles mail. Before this point I was having gmail send all my email to my mac address and then using <a href="http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html">Act-on</a> to sort it into different folders. This worked alright when I was at home and had time to sort my email, unfortunately, I'm not always on my mac... and <em>sometimes</em> .mac was down.
<img alt="Screen of gmail" src="myEmail_work.png" title="Picture of gmail">
Currently, I only use gmail and I've set up some labels and filters to manage it all. I have emails sent individually so that I can follow different threads quickly.</p>
<p>But I still enjoy working with a desktop client, if only for the sake of it flowing well with the rest of my "workflow" that includes working with omnifocus and a couple other tools that I like to use. If I can add one more issue against Mail.app that I haven't seen mentioned yet is that it doesn't allow you to color the heading on different threads.
<img alt="Screen of mail.app" src="mail_screen.png" title="Picture of mail.app"></p>
<p>Well, thank you for your time!</p>

<p>My wife and I took the kids to Costco today to load up on some of the necessities (namely toilet paper). As it is now fall, Costco has brought out some of their winter wear and my wife was a beautiful peacoat. My wife loves peacoats and has been saying that she would like something new because she's been loosing weight due to her new found passion for running. Like any husband I would love to get her the dress, but we have already bought her two other jackets in the last year plus a Scottevest that we got on sale two weeks ago.</p>
<p>We can't afford it. We haven't a need nor do we have any money in the budget for it.</p>
<p>My wife tries on a few and then sadly places the item back.</p>
<p>That's when my oldest daughter asks why.</p>
<p>I don't even think about it and say, "We don't have the money to buy it."</p>
<p>Instantly, my wife get's angry. Later on we talk about it briefly in the car and she tells me that I should have told our daughter about it in a different way.</p>
<p>"Should I have said, 'We can't afford it'?"</p>
<p>"No, you should say it in a way so she won't misunderstand and get picked on."</p>
<p>I let the subject drop because I'm frustrated. As far as I'm concerned, I told my daughter exactly why we couldn't buy the coat in a way that shouldn't make anyone feel offended. I think it's one of the most important financial lessons an adult (or any one else for that matter) should know. You don't buy things if you can't afford them. If I had learned this lesson earlier or taken it to heart years ago, I'd be in a different financial situation. I don't want my daughters to go down that path an I certainly don't want them to think that they are less because they can't get everything they want.</p>
<p>It's ok to know our limits.</p>
<p>But didn't I just say that I'm guilty of this as well?</p>
<p>Yes, b-b-but...</p>
<p><em>sigh</em> </p>
<p>I've decided to place myself on a spending diet. I've already paid most of my bills for this month. I'm going to set aside $200 for gas and other expenses and place that in a my new Golden1 checking account and see how things go from there. I'm hoping that it helps me realize that the money my family needs to survive is different then the money I use for wantsies. </p>

<p>I'd like to take this time to thank myself for not going completely crazy this last week. Crying babies, very little sleep and just the aftermath of all the drama from last month and I'm still standing...</p>
<p>...although a little wobbly!</p>
<p>But, I'd like to take some time and do a little weekly review.</p>
<p>Personal accomplishments this week:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finish two projects for work that will reward the company for a while </li>
<li>Keep my cool despite the constant pressure to find a new place and money to pay for it. </li>
<li>Cut back on my liquid sugar intake. No soda! </li>
<li>Did a weekly review</li>
</ol>
<p>Things Still on my Mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to make more income </li>
<li>How to improve the relationship I have with my family </li>
<li>What are some more activities that I can do with my children in the winter time</li>

<p>Today, I woke up from a nightmare. I dreamed that I was unable to move forward with my life. That there was some list out there that kept track of my every mistake and that it prevented me from getting a raise at my current job or to move to another job. There was a guy who let me look at the list and it was filled with minute and cryptic offenses. The whole time I stood there shocked because there wasn't a way to defend myself... it was all on the paper that I wasn't supposed to see in the first place. What do I do? How can this be fair? Some of the things were so small as to seems inconsequential. Some of them had nothing to do with who I was, what I had done in the past or how I had changed over the years.</p>
<p>Waking up, I realized that I was looking at the fear I've of just letting my past mistakes dictate who I am and denying myself of the possibility of being better.</p>
