</header><p>I was in a dark place. It was a cage with other people and a couple lights above us. </p>
<p>I could hear people walking across and i knew who they were.</p>
<p>They were being judged and they were going to heaven.</p>
<hr />
<p>and then a man came down dressed in black and drinking a cup of coffee. he asked "why should you live?" as he sipped his drink and sat down.</p>
<p>"how can i find my pashion," i yelled.</p>
<p>he almost spat out his coffee... </p>
<p>he readjusted himself in the chair and repeated the question as if i hadnt said anyhting.</p>
<p>i felt like i was doomed and helpless. that nothing i said or did would change anything...</p>
<p>i feeling that im too familiar with...</p>

</header><p>So for the last couple of months I've been carrying a large spiral notebook that I got from staples. I had planned on using it to capture ideas and as The One Tool<sup id="fnref:tool"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tool" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that would change all of my disorganization into a simple constantly productive life. As will all my new tools it was great for getting thoughts down and being able to read them over. </p>
<p>The only major problem I had was that I could put it in my pocket and just leave right away, I had to have some kind of bag or give up a free hand in order to carry it.</p>
<p>Another thing is that my daughters see it and think "Hey, it drawing time" and now it's halfway filled with their little snippets of stories and artwork.</p>
<p>Personally, it's made it even easier to keep around.</p>

</header><p>My oldest daughter has fallen in love with our iPad. She has gone from being an avid reader to coming home and asking for it as soon as she steps through the door. Sometimes she even asks for it as we drive up to our home.</p>
<p>Part of me is proud about how she has mastered moving around on the device. I've sometimes seen her start a movie in Netflix or watching things on YouTube. My wife loves telling her co-workers how our daughters can do things that some adults have difficulty doing.</p>
<p>But that is part of the problem. My daughter <em>can</em> do things other adult have trouble doing. Things like place an item into an Amazon shopping cart and proceed to the check out, find "special" offers on Disney  merchandise and then place her personal information in one of the forms.</p>
<p>Honestly, I've been lucky that she hasn't ordered hunders of books and horse toys.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this problem is that she's grown rather fond of a series of fan fiction trailers about the Lion King. Although at first glance there isn't anything wrong with seeing how people can take something and make it so much more. When she run over to me and says that certain characters share a different relationship and lineage that I feel is <em>kosher</em> that's when I got to step on the breaks.</p>
<p>Maybe, part of this is my fault for pushing technology and all it's wonderful whizz bangs without giver her some kind of limitations. But the geek in my wanted to see what she could do if she were to explore on her own. The part of me that says "you must always be a vigilant parent" lost to the part of that wants to let her be free and a kid.</p>
<p>That is what makes this part bitter sweet. I know the world isn't filled with magical talking animals. My daughter knows this too. But there is no need to disillusion her to the good in people and the good of moral character. She doesn't need to worry about wether Simba and Nala are really first cousins. She doesn't need to worry about a whole bunch of books showing up that she needs to pay for. She shouldn't worry about meeting some stranger on the internet. She needs to just have fun and be a kid.</p>

</header><p>I feel that one of my greatest weaknesses is that I underestimate myself and my abilities. For a large part of my life, I've had a voice in my head that told me that I'm not good enough. </p>
<ul>
<li>Not good enough to be a writer, so I never took the time to write.</li>
<li>Not good enough to be a dancer, so I never pursued competition.</li>
<li>Not good enough to make it as a programmer, so I never submitted an application to anyone other than teachers and close friends and afterward I never bothered to save my own code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not pretty.</p>
<p>It is only when I stop myself and look at all the little things that I do and make a daily list of accomplishments that I find the strength say, "Yes, I can and did."</p>
<p>They say life is made up of little things, and it is up to all of us to find the little things in life that will move us forward. </p>
<p>One time, I said that I'd rather live a life where I regretted some of the outcomes of things that I'd done rather than living with the regret that I didn't do anything. Turns out that I was living a life filled with simple regret instead of going out there and just living.</p>
<p>I'm not going to get on the horn and start outlining all the things that I plan on doing because I know how plans can change. All I can do is be true to myself and look at how I can change my course to live my dreams...</p>

</header><p>Today, I'm going to nock some things off of my project list for a while now.</p>
<p>The first thing that I'm going to do after dropping off the kids is redo my website. I've put up a place holder for now, but I'm sick of not having a place on the internet that isn't really mine. I'm going to have a really basic design and then just take it from there. I think I might even place it back onto NearlyFreeSpeech.net again because they had one of the easier ways of hosting and I didn't have to worry about forwarding the www.quotidianquest.com<sup id="fnref:www"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:www" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I think one other thing about this project is to finish my version of my formatting markdown script. I've been pushing it back for quite a while and I can't get it off of my mind. I'd really like to have something to show the world and just be able to move on with something else.</p>
<p>As for my other project that I'm going to be moving on to. I'm going to work on my trust issues with my project tracking system. I don't review it often enough to trust it and I find myself letting things fall by the way side. I think I'm going to focus on getting things out of my mind and dedicating time on my calendar to review things at the beginning and end of the day. </p>
<div class="footnote">

<ol>
<li id="fn:www">
<p>I don't know if that's really an issue any more, but it really bugs me that that isn't working when I'm hosting on github.

</header><p>I don't know where I'm going to be next week at this time.</p>
<p>Those are the first words that I can think of as I stare at the computer trying to come up with something write about for today. It's not that I don't know what I'll be doing<sup id="fnref:doing"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:doing" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but what am I going to be thinking about when I do it. Will I be worried about when my next paycheck is going to come in or am I going to happy that we just finished another birthday party for the kids. Will I have to worry about whether or not I have to put the dog down because he's been having some digestive problems.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I've been looking for ways to not get into a rut since loosing my job almost a month ago. All I can think of is the worry about what my next step is going to be and how horrible it will be if such and such doesn't happen for me. Almost none of my energy has gone into making things happen for me. </p>
<p>It almost feels like I'm catatonic, or a ghost standing over my own body and watching as time and life just slip by me.</p>
<p>The only good news is that I feel that I'm finally slipping through some of the fog and actually moving forward with some things again.</p>
<p>Like with a lot of things in life, the first step is the hardest.</p>

</header><p>My wife had her wisdom teeth removed last Friday and she's still in pain. They say that if momma ain't happy then no one is<sup id="fnref:momma"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:momma" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but -other than the occasional rough spot brought by the fact that she's in pain and can't eat- it's pretty smooth.</p>
<p>In fact, it's given me more opportunities to interact with the girls and show them that I can be just as fun as mommy. </p>
<p>For example, my youngest usually screams like a banshee when we clean her hair, but we turned it into a fun game where she got to play with the shower head and squirt around the bath tub. Both of them liked it and we didn't have to clean up buckets of water.</p>
<h2>Working Out</h2>
<p>I also had my second workout at innovative fitness but I think that it could have been better. Most of the exercises are new to me and I'm spending more of my time focusing on the technique versus pushing myself a little bit harder.</p>
<p>My knees have been hurting me when I do lunges and the exercises that the couch has been throwing at us has some kind of lunge. </p>
<p>I think that it might be what's holding me back. I'm scared of pain. I don't want to hurt myself, but it made me think about all the times that I didn't push myself because it hurt.</p>

</header><p>I was driving over to the post office to drop off my unemployment papers and I was thinking about my father. I do respect and love my father, but sometimes I see the scars that life has given him. There are moments where I see the bitterness seeping out of him. </p>
<p>Although I lived in his house for more than half of my life, there are many things I don't know about him. I don't know all the troubles he lived through and there have been times when I've wondered why does he feel a certain way about different things. </p>
<p>There have been many times that he's ranted about something and I've thought he was crazy. The thing is that's I feel that he's right to a degree, but the way he talks about it doesn't help his argument.</p>
<p>The thing is, I don't know much about my father outside of being <em>my father</em>. </p>
<h2>What is important?</h2>
<p>Is it important that I know everything about my dad before he became my dad? No. The important thing is that he loves me and that I can trust him.</p>
<p>The reasons I think about this is that I wonder if he is happy. Is he proud of the majority of his choices in life and whether he's accomplished all of the goals that were truly important to him.</p>
<h2>Are we going anywhere with this?</h2>
<p>There are many times in my life where I've forgotten that how many sibilings that my parent have and what's their names are. I do know that my father has a brother... His name in John. I don't know if it's Jon, Jonathan or John... For a couple of years I thought it was Robert.</p>
<p>Last week, I was driving in the car with my family and I mentioned my brother.</p>
<p>My oldest daughter asked, "You got a brother?"</p>

</header><p>My wife had her wisdom teeth pulled today.</p>
<p>All four of them.</p>
<p>Well, things are going to be cheery around here. :)</p>
<p>I spent most of the day just caring for her or watching her sleep. It was kind of nice because it took me back to the early days of our relationship when I would just sit and stare as she slept. Natasha thought it was kind of creepy, but for me it was a rare moment of seeing her at peace.</p>
<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>I've prioritized my tech projects to two major things. </p>
<h3>The website</h3>
<p>I've taken my website down because I didn't like the direction (or lack thereof) it was taking. I originally had a lot of different ideas that I wanted to do, but got stuck with the tools on making it versus making the content the king. I've placed a holding page up for now while I come up with what the next step is going to be.</p>
<p>I haven't decided on whether I should move to a service lie calipin or just throw everything out and start completely from scratch.</p>
<h3>Re-starting my career</h3>
<p>I'm not happy with where I am and have decided that I need to start over from the very begining as far as my career is concerned. I'd like to take what I know about computer science and just go over all the little things that made me take the subject from the beginning. </p>
<p>On how to do this, I've been putting a plan together that focuses more on the how of computer science and "going deep" versus the why.</p>
