</header><p>Well, tonight is the night. I got the site design to where I'd like it to be. It's simple, easy to read and very fast. I tried looking at it in a couple of different view ports using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015-505/">Safari's Responsive Design Mode</a> and it made me even more sure about what I'm doing here. </p>
<p>I understand that there are a lot of css/javascript frameworks out there and it would have been <strong>A LOT</strong> easier just to pick something like that and start posting. There is something to be said about just focusing on the actual words that go in the blog instead of how it looks like. I wanted my site to reflect me and what I'm about.</p>
<p><span class='newthought'>This is a message to me</span> that I can complete the goals that I set out to do. It might take me a while but this has been so worth it.</p>
<h1>Next up</h1>
<p>Well, the initial design is done but there are a couple more things that I should probably finish up. </p>
<ol>
<li>Finish the rest of the tags (marginimage, columnimage)</li>
<li>Add the analytics <label for="analytical" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="analytical" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Not a real priority because I don</span></li>
<li>Clean up the Archive page</li>
<li>Create a 404 page</li>
<li>Decrease the spacing between multiple footnotes<sup id="fnref:footnotes"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:footnotes" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Clean up the regular expressions used to parse for the plugins <label for="irregular" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="irregular" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">During the process of trying to figure out how to do this theme, I spent a lot of time whether to do this in pelican as a plugin or the python markdown. I</span></li>
<li>Discuss Comments</li>
<li>Create options to make it easier to go to categories and tags</li>
<li>OpenGraph</li>
</ol>
<p>I've done a couple comparisons with other pelican templates and I feel that I should have some of this ready for other users who want to try out the Tufte style without worry so much about how it fits with what a website is supposed to do<sup id="fnref:goals"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:goals" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Well, it is getting kind of late for me here and I've got to push the button to make this public to the world.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:footnotes">
<p>When I was first introduced to markdown, one of the things I thought was the coolest was the fact that you could have these little babies to put on the bottom of the page. If you look through my archieves you'll see that I use them off and on to do my writing. Some websites have them at the end or use a popup to show them when you click on them. I think I'll probably move to side and margin notes. Either way, when you get two or more they really start eating up space.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:footnotes" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:goals">
<p>It took me a lot of time to pick a template when I first came to pelican and even then I found myself modifying it. &#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:goals" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

</header><p>This is just a quick little page that will have some examples of notes used in the Tufte style.</p>
<h1>Margins and Sidenotes</h1>
<p>Anyway, I hope this<label for="Basic-Marginnote" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label><input type="checkbox" id="Basic-Marginnote" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Margin notes can be used for more than just putting information about a particular article.</span> works or I'm going to have to work on it some more.</p>
<p>Also, I've got to work on sidenotes as well. I was having some problems with sidenotes because I didn't want to copy the code over because sidenotes<label for="siden gt ote-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="siden gt ote-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This is a random sidenote. It doesnt do anything other than let me know that I should be carefull of mixing and matching quotes</span> and margin notes have a lot of commonality.</p>
<h1>Text and blockquotes</h1>
<p>This is just a short section that shows the following block quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Followed by a short list of things</p>
<ul>
<li>Toothpaste</li>
<li>Brushe</li>
<li>Floss</li>
</ul>
<h1>New thoughts</h1>
<p><span class='newthought'>This is the new thought</span> followed by some ipsum text that I found. privacy commons-based peer production Arianna mathewi but what's the business model Tim Carmody metered model Wikipedia, hashtag Snarkmarket digital first hot news doctrine CPC learnings Free Darko Colbert bump <label for="sidenote2-id" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sidenote2-id" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This is a second sidenote that Ive put in the text to keep track of how they work together.</span> recontextualize free as in beer privacy A.J.

<h1>Figures</h1>
<p>The first thing I want to put together is the full width images to see if they work well.</p>
<p><figure class="fullwidth"><img src="/2015/12/napoleons-march.png"><figcaption>Napoleon March (Edward Tufte’s English translation)</figcation></figure></p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems like pelican is wrapping the figures in p tags so the original css can't format it the way that I'd like.</p>
<p>Followed by some other stuff as well. Like margin images. Like this cool image that I'll eventually put to the side. </p>
<h1>Tables</h1>
<p>This is the section that I'm going to put the tables. I don't think I'll be adding a lot of tables in my own writing, but I feel that I should make sure that something should be here.</p>
