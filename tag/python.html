<p>In my <a href="/2018/06/blog-accomplishments.html" title="Blog Accomplishments «Mandaris Moore»">last post</a>, I left off with a list of things that I wanted to work on for the next release of the design of the blog. I'm still changing the header at the top of the page and I've been working on improving the contrast of the colors you see for links to make it easier to read. Something you can't spot just by looking is the fact that <code>&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h3&gt;</code> tags don't correspond to the breakdown of the syntax of the rest of the site.</p>
<figure><img alt="A small sample of the code that was being generated." src="images/sample-of-previous-syntax.png" title="Generated HTML in Sublime looks cool!"><figcaption>A small sample of the code that was being generated.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="what-do-i-see-on-the-internet">What do I see on the internet</h3>
<p>I feel that a lot of the sites that are on the internet only use the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> tags and looking at some of the templates that I've come across for pelican use css classes to differentiate them in the design. </p>
<p>I don't have a problem with that, but I felt that it doesn't help those that might be using some kind of screen reader or parsing system<sup id="fnref-seo"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-seo">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="searching-for-a-solution">Searching for a solution</h3>
<p>Once again, I started looking for a place where this had already been fixed and quickly found one that would make sure that the html that <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html">python-markdown</a> would give me would match what I was expecting to give to my <a href="https://github.com/mandaris/modest" title="A very simple template for pelican">template</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cprieto">Christian Prieto</a> had already come up with this <a href="https://github.com/cprieto/mdx_downheader" title="Python Markdown Down Header Extension">handy solution</a> in 2016 and had put some tests and an example of how to incorporate it into pelican.</p>
<h3 id="but-there-are-further-complications">But there are further complications</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, pelican has changed since the original and I wasn't able to get the solution to work. The readme says to add the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">MD_EXTENSIONS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;downheader&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>But the latest documentation found <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/settings.html" title="Pelican Settings">here</a>, have the markdown default to be defined as a dictionary and not an array<sup id="fnref-doc"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-doc">2</a></sup>. The simplest way to get it to work is to change your <code>pelicanconfig.py</code> to have the following code.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Markdown Plugins</span>
<span class="n">MARKDOWN</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;extension_configs&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.codehilite&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;css_class&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;highlight&#39;</span><span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.extra&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
        <span class="s1">&#39;markdown.extensions.meta&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
<span class="hll">        <span class="s1">&#39;downheader&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{},</span>
</span>    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;output_format&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;html5&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>For me, I had to specify a value because the title of my site is in a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag and the article headers are in <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Markdown Plugins</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I've since made a <a href="https://github.com/cprieto/mdx_downheader/pull/5">pull request</a> so that others can get around this as well.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I'm happier and happier with the way that the site is coming together, but I'm afraid of the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a> that the site is accruing as I go along. I've to to make the readme a priority for those who come after me and want to make this design better.</p>
<p>I've also taken some time to just take the header and just make a <a href="https://github.com/mandaris/pelican-headers">standalone project</a> that demonstrates how it works. I points to the <code>simple</code> theme that comes with pelican so people can just download it after installing pelican, python-markdown and the mdx_downheader package.</p>

<p>I think I'm ready to mark my second pelican theme 1.0 as "Feature Complete" today! I started off with -what I thought- a simple premise of having a site site took a lot longer than I expected but I'm pretty happy with the site for now.  But before I tag it and start working on 2.0, I want to go over what I've done so far.</p>
<figure><img alt="Visualization of what I've accomplished with the blog." src="images/blog_accomplishments.png"> <figcaption>Visualization of what I've accomplished with the blog.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="parsable">Parsable</h3>
<p>The first thing I started researching was how to make the site parsable by webcrawlers. Although it's a personal blog, I wanted people to be able to find the content easily.</p>
<h4 id="opengraph">OpenGraph</h4>
<p>OpenGraph was the first thing that I came across and appealed to me the most because it's the preferred way of parsing data for Twitter<sup id="fnref-twitter"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-twitter">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I found it especially rewarding that the tags are also parsed by facebook and my new favorite social network <a href="https://slack.com">slack</a>. </p>
<p>One of the technical difficulties that I ran into when adding OpenGraph tags was adding the images. The specification for OpenGraph states that images to be used need to be added as meta data in the head of the html. This can be a pain as the other data like title and date can be pulled from the article itself and I didn't want to go through all my old posts to add image meta data.</p>
<p>Luckily, the  github user WhiskyEchoBravo had a <a href="https://github.com/whiskyechobravo/pelican-open_graph">project that searched the content of the post for images</a> and added the first to the list of tags. I'm a little proud that I helped with issues with <a href="https://github.com/whiskyechobravo/pelican-open_graph/commit/61248d805588245a9fc1dc4eda56cff1f5a9d8fa">pages</a>. </p>
<p>Afterwards, I did run into some frustration when the images that I added to posts wouldn't be as big as I expected.</p>
<figure><img alt="Post in slack with a small image." src="images/slack-small-image.png"><figcaption>Post in slack with a small image.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ultimately, I think it's because of the mixing and matching of having OpenGraph and twitter specific tags and was solved it by making sure I used the following for my twitter card.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">meta</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;twitter:card&quot;</span> <span class="na">content</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;summary_large_image&quot;</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And now I get the post to unfurl nicely.</p>
<figure><img alt="Post in slack with a large image." src="images/slack-large-image.png"><figcaption>Post in slack with a large image.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="schemaorg">Schema.org</h4>
<p>This is the styling used by both Bing and Google. I put this in as a challenge to myself to make it work in both instances. I leaned a lot from the example on <a href="https://orbitingweb.com/blog/schema-org-microdata-guide/" title="Complete Schema.Org and Microdata Tutorial for beginners">OrbitingWeb</a> and refined what I was working with using <a href="https://github.com/philwareham/schema-microdata-examples/blob/master/blog.html" title="Schema.org microdata examples">another example</a> that I found on github.</p>
<h3 id="valid-semantic-tags">Valid Semantic Tags</h3>
<p>For this, I just wanted to use some of those really cool semantic tags that html5 has given to us. When I look at the code for some pages on the internet I see a lot of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags with classes that could be replaced with <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,  or <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags.</p>
<p>I'm willing to just attribute it to my desire to have my own style or maybe just inexperience, but I'm happy to report that the site passes html validation except for the OpenGraph definitions found in the header.</p>
<h4 id="figure-it-out">figure it out</h4>
<p>One technical hurdle I ran into was that I wanted my images to be wrapped in the <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tag and also have a <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> tag that would have the alternative text. </p>
<p>I searched for a plugin for pelican<sup id="fnref-figure-ref"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-figure-ref">2</a></sup>, but the closest thing I could find was <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/liquid_tags">liquid tags</a> at the time<sup id="fnref-liquid"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-liquid">3</a></sup>.  </p>
<p>I did find jdittrich <a href="https://github.com/jdittrich/figureAltCaption">figureAltCaption</a> project on github which was a extension for the <a href="https://python-markdown.github.io/">python-markdown</a>  that pelican uses. I even submitted a <a href="https://github.com/jdittrich/figureAltCaption/pull/3" title="Still wait to be pulled into the main branch">pull request</a>  to allow it to do reference links!</p>
<p>There was a little confusion on getting it to work because pelican has been changing since some of these plugins were created.</p>
<p>Long story short, I had to add the following to my <code>pelicanconfig.py</code> to get it to work.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   <span class="c1"># Markdown Plugins</span>
<span class="n">MARKDOWN</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</pre></div>


<h3 id="easy-to-share">Easy to share</h3>
<p>I wrote down that I wanted the site to be easy to share and it is when you look at the amount of tags and metadata that is in every page. </p>
<p>At one point, I wanted to add share buttons, but -with the rise in concerns about privacy- I wanted the users of the site to be the ones who would share it.</p>
<p>Also, I'm still working on color schemes so the buttons might clash with whatever I end up with.</p>
<figure><img alt="Clash of the social buttons!" src="images/supported-social-networks.jpg" title="The number of ways to share an article is too dang high!"><figcaption>Clash of the social buttons!</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="accessible">Accessible</h3>
<p>One of the underlining principles of this site design is that I wanted it to be accessible to as many people as possible. It's part of the reason that I've worked so hard on making sure that I included so many semantic tags. I didn't think that this was particularly hard to do when you understand what needs to happen before you begin. </p>
<p>The theme doesn't have any errors at this point, but does loose some points because of the way that markdown headers are handled and the fact that I picked a low contrast color for my links. I'll fix it soon.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-and-where-im-going-next">Conclusion and where I'm going next</h3>
<p>Overall, I'm happy with this version of the site and blogging about it has helped me think about what places I want to refine going forward. </p>
<h4 id="list-of-things-to-improve">List of things to improve</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a decent readme with all the packages and properties that the theme uses</li>
<li>Improve color contrast for reading</li>
<li>Add Cristian Prieto's <a href="https://github.com/cprieto/mdx_downheader">mdx_downheader</a></li>
<li>Make the top navigation a little less clunky</li>
<li>Look into how to integrate micro.blog posts</li>

<p>The power went out this morning and left the house in darkness except for my laptop. I took this time to get some work done with my plugin for <a href="http://www.getpelican.com">Pelican</a> but I found myself at a stand still because I wanted to get some information on how regular expressions parse results into a dictionary.</p>
<p>With the internet not working, I decided that I'd try seeing what is available with the REPL in python and I found it to be fairly helpful in the fact that I had access to the documentation in the same interface as the code that I was writing.</p>
<p>In my case, I wanted to find out what methods are part of the match class. Sure, I ran into a minor bump of not knowing how to get help to show me the documentation of match directory, but I quickly got around that by run help on the match object that I created.</p>

<p>Honestly, this gives me a little more confidence in myself that I can find things out on my own without having to turn to the internet and finding myself getting side tracked by all the destractions that someone can find. </p>
