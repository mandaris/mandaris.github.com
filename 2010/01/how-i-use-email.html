</header><p>Recently, Mac Developer Brent Simmons discussed on his <a href="http://inessential.com/2010/01/16/email_init">blog</a> about the importance of a good email client. Although, he said he wouldn't spearhead the project, he did start up a mailing list (ironic) for it. The list has been going crazy with people going back and forth over what the ideal mail client was and what should be in the 1.0 release.</p>
<p>One of the posters, Matthieu Cormier, has posted on his <a href="http://www.preenandprune.com/cocoamondo/?p=795">blog</a> how he uses Mail.app and I thought it would be a good exercise to re-evaulate how I use mail and maybe that would help move the discussion along.<br />

<p>Last year, I made the switch from .mac to gmail and it's been kind of interesting to see how Mail.app handles mail. Before this point I was having gmail send all my email to my mac address and then using <a href="http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html">Act-on</a> to sort it into different folders. This worked alright when I was at home and had time to sort my email, unfortunately, I'm not always on my mac... and <em>sometimes</em> .mac was down.

Currently, I only use gmail and I've set up some labels and filters to manage it all. I have emails sent individually so that I can follow different threads quickly.</p>
<p>But I still enjoy working with a desktop client, if only for the sake of it flowing well with the rest of my "workflow" that includes working with omnifocus and a couple other tools that I like to use. If I can add one more issue against Mail.app that I haven't seen mentioned yet is that it doesn't allow you to color the heading on different threads.

<p>Well, thank you for your time!</p>
