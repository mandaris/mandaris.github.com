I've been waiting for that perfect moment when it would be ready for the world. Unfortunately, it's been stifled because of my own drive for it to be perfect before it sees the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don't think anyone reads it and it's not going to get better unless I put some time into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before I put any more effort into it, I want to take some time and write about why I should keep it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Web Technology is cool&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like working on the web. Until this point, I never thought that I'd be considering a career where I'd be working on the web, but I've spent a lot of my life working or playing with something that is some how web related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Play around with different tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bare minimum, having a website allows you to play around with what can happen on the inter-webs and make that part of what people find when they google, bing or duck-duck-go your name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My Part of the web&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, having your own website is about control. I control the content and what it looks like and if I choose. I can shut it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vanity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Provide a Place to Share My Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't say much, but I know that this is the perfect platform because I choose to write here and I don't have to worry too much about saying "the wrong thing."&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Blogging workshop</title><link href="/2012/05/blogging-workshop.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-16T22:12:30-07:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-05-16:2012/05/blogging-workshop.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I went to a blogging workshop and I found it really interesting. At first, I was worried that it would filled with the standard novice information like how to get on the internet being taught by someone took 15 minutes to get some information off the internet and put it into a powerpoint presentation to read to use.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Hyde Doc suck</title><link href="/2012/01/hyde-doc-suck.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-01-25T10:41:34-08:00</updated><author><name>Mandaris</name></author><id>tag:,2012-01-25:2012/01/hyde-doc-suck.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently came across as &lt;a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hyde-dev/browse_thread/thread/db9213433190487f" title="Message post from Google Groups"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; from a goggle group that I'm part of that is centered around &lt;a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde" title="Hyde on GitHub"&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt; which is what I'm currently using to statically generate my website/blog. The email was basically asking "What's up with the docs?" and all I can do is just shake my head in agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that a significant amount of these open source projects are created by people whose talent is mostly with the creation of the tools and not with the associatated docs. This leaves a lot of people in the dust because people see the end result and want to have something cool like that, but don't have the time/desire to dive into the code and learn how it works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not because they are lazy, it because we are all busy people and sometimes we don't need to know every aspect of something to use it. For example, you don't have to be a mechanic to drive your car&lt;sup id="fnref:car"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:car" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I wish I could help this guy out because I've had similar problems with this and other projects and it can be daunting to stick your head out and ask the questions. But you have to have the &lt;a href="http://www.43folders.com/2008/12/01/courageous-sucking" title="Photography, and the Tolerance for Courageous Sucking via 43folders"&gt;courage to suck&lt;/a&gt; in order to get any better at something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:car"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... but a little more knowledged in this area can save you a ton of money.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:car" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
