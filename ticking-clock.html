</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Currently, I'm sitting in an office waiting for my friend to get finished talking to his doctor. I've been doing this for the last couple of weeks, and it is has been nice to see my friend a little bit more. I feel that we've both have been walking our own paths and neither one of us is happy about it. When we see each other, we get a chance to talk about our own grievances and help cheer each other on as we make our way towards are respective goals.</p>
<p>For me, I've been playing with the idea of doing affirmations and spending time everyday writing out 5 things that I'm excited/happy about as well as grateful for<sup id="fnref:grateful"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:grateful" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As for my friend, I don't know all the things that he is doing to relieve stress and just move forward with his life. I kind of just want to give him a big hug and tell him that it's going to be alright, but I know that isn't going to be enough. It isn't enough for me either and when it comes to stuff like this, you have make your own choices on how you are going to make yourself a better person.</p>
